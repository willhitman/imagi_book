THE VANISHING OF ROOM 4B: PAGES 1–50
Page 1
The silence in Room 4B isn’t the normal kind of silence. Usually, Tuesday mornings are a riot of slamming locker doors, Sam’s frantic questions about the math homework, and Mr. Henderson’s ancient coffee percolator bubbling away like a science experiment gone wrong. But today, the percolator is cold. The chalkboard is perfectly, unnervingly clean. And Toby’s desk—the one in the back left with the peeling dinosaur sticker—is empty. You sit at your desk, your backpack still heavy on your shoulders. You glance at Sam. He’s chewing on the end of a pencil so hard you’re worried it might snap. He catches your eye and taps his wrist, pointing to the clock. 8:15 AM. Mr. Henderson is never late. He lives for the 8:10 AM “Fun Fact of the Day.” Then, the door creaks open. It isn’t Mr. Henderson’s cheerful, bumbling entrance. It’s a slow, deliberate sound. A woman steps inside wearing a grey suit so sharp it looks like it could cut paper. Her hair is pulled back into a bun so tight it makes her eyes look startled. "My name is Ms. Grimm," she says. Her voice sounds like two stones grinding together. "Mr. Henderson is... indisposed. Open your textbooks to page 142. No talking. No questions."
Page 2
The morning passes in a blur of agonizing quiet. Ms. Grimm doesn't teach; she just paces the aisles like a sentry guarding a prison. Every time you try to whisper to Sam, her cold, grey eyes snap to yours, and you freeze. Toby’s empty chair feels like a giant hole in the room. Toby is your best friend. He’s the guy who knows the secret menu at the ice cream shop and can recite the entire plot of every monster movie ever made. He wouldn't just skip school. Not today. Not when you were supposed to trade your rare holographic cards at lunch. Finally, the bell rings for recess. "Go," Ms. Grimm commands, not looking up from her desk. "Return in fifteen minutes. Not a second later." The class scrambles out, but Maya lingers. As you and Sam pass the teacher’s desk, Maya stoops down as if to tie her shoe. With a movement as fast as a cobra, she reaches into the trash can and tucks something under her hoodie. "Keep walking," she whispers as she catches up to you in the hallway. Once you’re outside, hidden behind the equipment shed, Maya pulls it out. It’s Mr. Henderson’s black leather planner.
Page 3
Sam fumbles with his glasses, leaning in. "Open it. Maybe he just... forgot it?" Maya flips through the pages. Most are filled with mundane notes about lesson plans and grocery lists. But then she stops at today’s date. Tuesday, October 12th. Circled in thick, aggressive red ink are the words: THE PROJECT BEGINS TODAY. "The Project?" Sam asks, his voice climbing an octave. "What project? We aren't doing a project. We just finished the unit on tectonic plates!" "Look at the bottom," you say, pointing to a yellow sticky note tucked into the corner of the page. The handwriting on the note isn't Mr. Henderson’s neat, loopy cursive. It’s messy, jagged, and familiar. It’s Toby’s handwriting. It says: I SAW WHAT THEY DID. A cold shiver traces its way down your spine. "They?" you mutter. "Who are 'they'?" Suddenly, a low meow catches your attention. You look toward the edge of the Forbidden Woods—the overgrown forest behind the playground that is strictly off-limits. Sitting on the stone wall is a mangy black cat with one white ear. "That’s Toby’s cat," Sam whispers. "Shadow. What is he doing at school?" The cat stares at you with bright green eyes, then turns and leaps into the dense undergrowth.
Page 4
The trio stands in a tight circle, the weight of the mystery pressing down on you. The school bell rings—a harsh, metallic clang that sounds more like an alarm than a signal to go to class. "We can't go back in there," you say, looking at the looming brick building of Oakhaven Elementary. "Not while Toby and Mr. Henderson are missing. We have to do something." "We need a plan," Sam says, reaching into his backpack and pulling out a pair of walkie-talkies. "Logic dictates we look for the most likely location. Mr. Henderson lives only three blocks away. If he’s 'indisposed,' maybe he’s there. Or maybe Toby ran there to hide." "I don't know," Maya counters, looking back at the school. "Did you see the way the janitor was looking at us when we left the building? He was heading for the boiler room with a crate of... something. It looked like high-tech equipment. And Toby was always talking about weird noises coming from the basement pipes." You look toward the woods. Shadow the cat is gone, but the bushes are still rustling. "Toby spent all weekend in those woods looking for 'anomalies,'" you remind them. "If he saw 'what they did,' maybe he saw it out there."
Page 5
You are the leader of the Detective Club. You have to make the call. Time is running out, and you can feel Ms. Grimm’s eyes watching from the second-story window. Which path do you take?

If you decide to sneak into the school’s basement and investigate the boiler room, TURN TO PAGE 75.
If you decide to follow Toby’s cat into the Forbidden Woods, TURN TO PAGE 140.
Page 6
The bell for the end of recess screams—a jagged, electric sound that makes Sam jump high enough to nearly drop his walkie-talkie. "We have to go back in," Maya says, her eyes darting toward the school’s side entrance. She quickly shoves Mr. Henderson’s planner deep into her backpack, burying it under her history folder. "If Ms. Grimm notices we’re late, she’ll call the office. If the office calls our parents, we’re dead. And if we’re dead, we can’t find Toby." "Logic checks out," Sam mutters, though his knees are shaking. "But Toby’s note... 'I saw what they did.' What if 'they' are still in the building? What if 'they' are the ones who put Ms. Grimm in our classroom?" You look at the heavy oak doors of the school. They look less like an entrance now and more like a mouth. "We stay close," you say, trying to sound like a leader. "We don't go anywhere alone. Not even to the bathroom." As you walk back down the hallway toward Room 4B, you notice the janitor, Mr. Pike, is standing by the trophy case. Usually, he’s whistling or complaining about floor wax. Today, he’s silent. He’s holding a clipboard, making a small mark on his paper for every student that walks by. Counted. You’re being counted.
Page 7
Back in Room 4B, the air feels even colder. Ms. Grimm is standing at the chalkboard, but she isn't writing math equations. She’s drawing a series of interlocking circles that look more like a blueprint than a lesson. "Sit," she says without turning around. You slide into your seat. You look at Toby’s empty desk. A single, crumpled piece of paper sits on his chair. You’re positive it wasn't there ten minutes ago. You wait for Ms. Grimm to walk to the other side of the room. You lean over, your heart drumming against your ribs, and snatch the paper. It’s a drawing. Toby was always sketching monsters, but this isn't a monster. It’s a map of the school’s basement, but with an extra room drawn in messy, thick pencil. He’s labeled it THE COOLER. Underneath, in shaky letters, he wrote: Mr. H went down. He didn't come up. "Leo?" Ms. Grimm’s voice cracks like a whip. You sit bolt upright, shoving the drawing into your pocket. She’s staring at you, her grey eyes narrowed behind her spectacles. "Is there something more interesting than the curriculum on your friend’s chair?" "No, Ms. Grimm," you say, your voice remarkably steady. "Just a... a stray piece of lint."
Page 8
The rest of the afternoon is a slow-motion nightmare. You, Sam, and Maya exchange frantic looks, but the "No Talking" rule is strictly enforced. Ms. Grimm doesn't even let anyone get up to sharpen a pencil. At 2:00 PM, a black van pulls up to the curb outside the classroom window. It has no markings, no logo, and the windows are tinted so dark they look like ink. Two men in identical charcoal suits get out. They don't go to the front office. They walk straight toward the side door—the one that leads to the basement. Maya sees it too. She scribbles something on a scrap of paper and "accidentally" drops it near your desk. You lean down to pick it up. The van is registered to a 'medical supply' company, the note reads. I saw the license plate. It’s the same one that was parked outside Mr. Henderson’s house this morning when I biked past. Your mind races. If the van is at the school and was at the teacher’s house, this is bigger than just a missed day of school.
Page 9
Suddenly, the intercom crackles to life. Usually, this is when the Principal announces the bus numbers or the winners of the canned food drive. But the voice on the speaker isn't the Principal. It’s a flat, synthesized voice that sounds like a computer trying to mimic a human. "Attention staff. The Project has reached Phase One. Please secure all designated assets. Repeat: Secure all assets." Ms. Grimm immediately stands up. She doesn't say a word. She walks to the classroom door, turns the deadbolt, and pulls the shades over the windows. "The school is now under a temporary lockdown," she says, her voice devoid of emotion. "You will remain in your seats. Do not approach the windows. Do not use your phones." Sam reaches into his bag and grips his walkie-talkie. He looks at you, his eyes wide with terror. "Leo," he whispers, "she’s locking us in. We have to move now, or we’re next."
Page 10
This is it. The moment where you have to decide. The lockdown is just starting—the hallways are still mostly empty, but teachers are starting to close their doors. "We have to get out of this room," Maya whispers, sliding her backpack onto her shoulders. "If we stay here, we’re 'assets.' If we leave, we’re investigators." "But where do we go?" Sam asks. "If we go to the basement, we’re walking right into whatever Toby saw. If we go to Mr. Henderson’s house, we might find out what those men in the van were looking for. And if we go to the woods... well, Shadow is still out there. Maybe Toby is too." You look at the back window. The lock is old. You could pop it open and be on the fire escape in seconds. Or you could wait for Ms. Grimm to turn her back and bolt through the door toward the basement. Or, you could wait for the final bell—if it even rings—and follow the cat. "Three directions," you mutter. "Three ways this ends."
Page 11
Maya is looking at the window. "Mr. Henderson’s house is only three blocks away. We could be there in five minutes. If those men left, they might have left a trail." You look at Maya's face; she is determined. She’s the one who always keeps her head in a crisis, and right now, she’s convinced that Henderson’s home is the epicenter of the disappearance. "But what if Ms. Grimm sees us?" Sam asks, his voice barely a breath. "She's watching the door, but she’s not watching the fire escape. We have to go now." You look at the window latch. It’s rusty, but you think you can pry it open with the screwdriver on your multi-tool.
Page 12
Sam is looking at the floorboards. "The basement, Leo. Toby’s map. 'The Cooler.' If he’s still in the building, we can't leave him behind. I have my high-lumen flashlight and the multi-tool. We can do this." Sam’s anxiety has been replaced by a weird kind of technical focus. He’s already checking the batteries on his walkie-talkies. He knows the layout of the school better than anyone, and he knows that the boiler room has a service elevator that most people forget about. "If 'The Project' is starting," Sam says, "then whatever they are doing is happening right under our feet."
Page 13
You look out the sliver of the window that isn't covered by the shade. Far off, at the edge of the Forbidden Woods, you see a flash of orange. It’s Toby’s favorite hunter-orange beanie. Someone—or something—is moving through the trees. "Toby?" you whisper. You can't be sure, but the height was right. And if Toby is in the woods, he’s safe from the suits in the van for now. "The Project," you mutter. "Whatever it is, it's happening right now." You grab your bag. You signal to Sam and Maya. They stand up quietly, their hearts pounding in sync with yours. Ms. Grimm is busy at the chalkboard again, erasing her circles with a frantic, scratching sound. "On my signal," you breathe.
Page 14
The room is silent except for the scratching of chalk. You wait for the exact moment Ms. Grimm reaches the top corner of the board. Now. You slide toward the window. Maya and Sam follow like shadows. You click the multi-tool into place and wedge the screwdriver into the window frame. With a groan of ancient wood, the window slides up just enough for a person to squeeze through. The cold air of the October morning hits your face, smelling of damp earth and adventure. "Go," you whisper to Maya. She disappears over the sill. Then Sam. Then you.
Page 15
The Detective Club is ready. You have three leads, but you can only follow one. The fate of Toby and Mr. Henderson depends on your intuition. You look at Sam and Maya, and they nod, waiting for your signal. The clock on the wall seems to be ticking louder with every second that passes. Which path do you take?
If you decide the answer lies at the teacher’s house, TURN TO PAGE 16.
If you decide Toby is still inside the school basement, TURN TO PAGE 75.
If you decide the woods hold the key, TURN TO PAGE 140.
Page 16
The window groans as you push it upward. It hasn’t been opened since the Truman administration, and the peeling green paint flakes off like snow. "I’ll go first," you whisper. You swing your legs over the sill, feeling the cool autumn air hit your face. It’s a six-foot drop to the bushes below. You hit the mulch with a soft thud, followed quickly by Maya, who lands as silently as a cat. Then comes Sam. He tosses his backpack down first, but as he tries to climb out, his hoodie gets snagged on the window latch. He dangles there, legs kicking frantically. "I’m a goner!" he hisses. "Tell my parents I died for science!" "Shhh!" Maya grabs his ankles and hoists him down. Sam hits the ground in a heap, adjusting his glasses. "That," Sam pants, "was a tactical error. We need to move. The Black Van is parked right around the corner." You peek around the edge of the brick wall. The van is idling, exhaust curling from the tailpipe. You can’t see the driver through the tinted glass, but you can see a satellite dish on the roof.
If you try to sneak past the van by crawling through the drainage ditch, TURN TO PAGE 17.
If you make a dash for the playground fence to take the long way around, TURN TO PAGE 18.
Page 17
"The ditch," you decide. "It’s muddy, but it’s deep. They won’t see us from the van." The three of you drop into the concrete trench that runs along the edge of the teacher's parking lot. It smells like wet leaves and old sneakers. You crawl on all fours, your heart hammering. Suddenly, the van’s side door slides open. A pair of heavy black boots hits the pavement just three feet from your hiding spot. "Target is missing," a deep voice growls. You hear the crackle of a radio. "Initiate the sweep. Check the perimeter." Sam turns pale. They’re looking for Toby, he mouths. The man in the boots starts walking toward the ditch. You hold your breath, pressing your face into the mud. Just as he reaches the edge, a loud MEOW echoes from the other side of the parking lot. Shadow, Toby’s cat, is sitting on the hood of a silver sedan, hissing. The man turns. "Stray cat," he mutters, and walks back to the van. "Shadow saved us," Maya whispers. "Let's move while he’s distracted." TURN TO PAGE 19.
Page 18
"The fence!" you yell. "Run!" You sprint across the open grass, Sam and Maya hot on your heels. Your sneakers thud against the turf. You feel like a target in a video game, waiting for the van to roar to life and chase you down. You reach the chain-link fence and scramble over it, the metal clinking loudly. You drop onto the sidewalk of Maple Street just as a siren wails in the distance. "Do you think Ms. Grimm noticed?" Sam asks, clutching his side. "Doesn't matter now," you say, looking down the street. "Look." Two blocks away, a figure is standing on the porch of a small blue house. It’s a man in a trench coat, and he’s frantically stuffing papers into a briefcase. He looks exactly like the "shady contact" Toby once described from one of his spy movies. "Is that him?" Maya asks, squinting. "Is that the kidnapper?"
If you chase the man in the trench coat, TURN TO PAGE 20.
If you ignore him and go straight to Mr. Henderson’s house, TURN TO PAGE 19.
Page 19
Mr. Henderson’s house at 142 Maple Lane looks... wrong. Usually, the lawn is manicured and there are plastic flamingos wearing little seasonal hats on the porch. Today, the flamingos are knocked over, and a stack of newspapers is piled up so high the bottom ones are turning into mush. "The mailbox is overflowing," Maya notes, her detective brain clicking into gear. "He’s been gone longer than just today." You approach the front door. You notice a dark, brownish-red stain on the welcome mat. It looks thick and sticky. "Blood!" Sam shrieks, pointing. "It’s a massacre! We should call the police. No, we should call the army!" "Wait," Maya says, kneeling down. She touches the stain and sniffs her finger. "It’s... wait. It smells like... Campbell’s?" "Campbell's?" you ask. "Tomato soup," she says, looking confused. "It’s definitely tomato soup."
If you decide the soup is a "distraction" and try to pick the lock on the front door, TURN TO PAGE 21.
If you go around to the back to look through the basement window, TURN TO PAGE 22.
Page 20
"Follow that trench coat!" you command. You race down the sidewalk, trying to keep your distance. The man is fast. He reaches a dark green car, throws the briefcase into the passenger seat, and peels out, his tires screeching. "Did you get the plate?" you yell at Sam. Sam fumbles with his digital camera, clicking a blurry photo of the car’s rear bumper. "I got it! 'G-R-M-P-Y-1.' What kind of code is that?" "Grumpy 1?" Maya says. "Maybe his code name is The Dwarf? Like from Snow White?" "Or maybe he's part of a secret grumpy society," Sam adds, terrified. Suddenly, the car stops at a red light. You have a chance to see who’s inside. You creep up to the window and peek in. It’s an old man with a scowl, wearing a badge that says Official Mail Carrier. "It’s just the mailman," Maya sighs. "The 'shady papers' were just... mail." TURN TO PAGE 19 TO GO TO HENDERSON'S HOUSE.
Page 21
"I’m going in," you say. You pull your multi-tool from your pocket. You’ve never actually picked a lock before, but you’ve watched enough YouTube videos to feel like an expert. Jiggle. Click. The door swings open. The house is silent, except for a low, rhythmic thumping sound coming from the kitchen. "Do you hear that?" Sam whispers. "It sounds like... a heart. A giant, mechanical heart." You creep into the hallway. The walls are covered in photos of Mr. Henderson's prize-winning roses. In the kitchen, you see the source of the noise. A large, silver machine is shaking violently on the counter. "It’s a centrifuge!" Sam gasps. "He’s extracting DNA! He’s making clones!" You move closer. The machine has a timer on it. 0:05... 0:04... 0:03... "GET DOWN!" you yell, diving behind the kitchen island. DING! The machine stops. A pleasant aroma fills the air. You look up. It’s a high-end bread maker. A loaf of sourdough is sitting inside, perfectly browned. "False alarm," Maya says, but then she points to the floor. "But that isn't." Tucked under the bread maker is a handwritten note: They are watching the house. If I don't return by 5:00, tell the Principal the 'Science Gala' must be cancelled. TURN TO PAGE 23.
Page 22
You head to the backyard. The grass is long and tickles your ankles. You find the small, rectangular window that leads into Mr. Henderson's basement. "I can see something," you whisper, leaning down. Inside, the basement is bathed in a weird, flickering blue light. There are dozens of screens, all showing what looks like a map of the school. Red dots are moving through the hallways of Oakhaven Elementary. "He’s tracking us," Sam says, his voice trembling. "He’s been spying on the whole school!" "Look at the corner," Maya says. In the corner of the basement, you see a familiar shape. It’s Toby’s backpack. And next to it is a large, black trunk labeled: PROPERTY OF THE PROJECT. DO NOT OPEN. "Toby is in that trunk!" Sam cries. "I know it! We have to break the window!"
If you smash the window with a rock, TURN TO PAGE 24.
If you try to find a different way in so you don't set off an alarm, TURN TO PAGE 25.
Page 23
"The Science Gala?" you repeat. "That’s what he called the 'Project' in the planner. But why would he be scared to cancel a party?" "Unless it's not a party," Maya says. She picks up a flyer from the counter. Oakhaven Science Gala: A Night of Transformation. "Transformation," Sam gulps. "That’s what the lab does. They turn kids into... into super-geniuses. Or zombies. Or super-genius zombies!" Suddenly, the front door slams shut. You hear heavy footsteps in the hallway. "Mr. Henderson?" you call out. No answer. A shadow appears under the kitchen door. It’s a tall, thin shadow—the same shape as Ms. Grimm. "Hide!" you hiss.
If you hide in the pantry, TURN TO PAGE 30.
If you hide in the basement stairwell, TURN TO PAGE 22.
Page 24
CRACK! You throw a rock through the basement window. Glass shatters everywhere. The sound is deafening in the quiet neighborhood. "Go, go, go!" you yell. You scramble through the broken frame, cutting your sleeve on a jagged edge. You land on a pile of laundry. Sam and Maya tumble in after you. You race to the black trunk. "Toby! Toby, are you in there?" You fumbled with the latches. They’re stuck. You use the screwdriver on your multi-tool to pry them open. With a loud snap, the lid flies back. You brace yourself for something horrible. But the trunk isn't full of Toby. It’s full of... dry ice and hundreds of "Mr. Henderson’s Famous Science Brownies." "Brownies?" Sam asks, reaching in and taking one. "The 'Project' is a bake sale?" "Wait," Maya says, pointing to the computer screens. "The 'maps' aren't the school. They’re maps of the local park. And the red dots... they have names." You look closer. The red dots are labeled: Squirrel 1, Squirrel 2, Squirrel 3. "He’s tracking squirrels for his nature blog," you groan. "We broke into his house for squirrels and brownies." TURN TO PAGE 40 TO FIND THE REAL TOBY.
Page 25
"We can't just smash the window," you say. "The neighbors will call the cops. Look for a spare key." You start flipping over rocks and looking under the doormat. Finally, Sam finds a fake plastic rock near the garden hose. He opens it, and a silver key falls out. "Got it!" You unlock the back door and creep inside. The house feels cold. As you pass the living room, you see Toby’s orange beanie sitting on the coffee table. "He was here," Maya says. "And he left this behind." She picks up the beanie. Inside, there’s another sticky note. This one says: The Principal knows. Don't go back to the school. Meet me at the arcade. "The arcade?" you ask. "But the arcade was shut down last month." "Exactly," Sam says. "It’s the perfect hideout. Nobody goes there anymore. But wait—if the Principal knows... who is he working for?" Just then, the phone on the wall begins to ring. You look at the Caller ID. It says: OAKHAVEN ELEMENTARY - MAIN OFFICE.
If you answer the phone, TURN TO PAGE 26.
If you run for the arcade, TURN TO PAGE 28.
Page 26
The phone continues to wail. Rring. Rring. In the quiet of Mr. Henderson’s living room, the sound is like a siren. "Don't answer it!" Sam whispers, his hands over his ears. "It’s a trap! They can track the signal! They’ll know we’re in the house!" "Or," Maya says, her eyes narrowing as she looks at the Caller ID, "it’s the Principal calling to check if Mr. Henderson is okay. If we answer, we can find out what the school knows." "And get caught breaking and entering?" Sam counters. "My life is too short for a juvenile record!" The phone stops. For three seconds, there is silence. Then, the answering machine clicks on. “You’ve reached Arthur Henderson. I’m busy with 'The Project' right now, but leave a message!” A voice comes through the speaker. It’s Mrs. Higgins, the school secretary. She sounds frantic. “Arthur? Are you there? The delivery arrived at the school, but it’s the wrong color! The Principal is furious. We need the ‘Specimen’ from your basement immediately or the whole thing is ruined! Call me back!” The machine beeps and falls silent. "The Specimen?" Sam gasps. "In the basement? We have to go back down there!"
If you go back to the basement to find "The Specimen," TURN TO PAGE 27.
If you head to the arcade to find Toby, TURN TO PAGE 28.
Page 27
You race back down the basement stairs. The blue light from the computer monitors is still flickering. "Search everything!" you command. "Mrs. Higgins said 'the specimen.' Look for jars, tanks, or... or cages!" Maya heads for a shelf full of old science journals. Sam starts poking around the furnace. You return to the black trunk where you found the brownies. Underneath the tray of snacks, there’s a false bottom. "Guys! Look!" You pull back the wood panel. Inside is a small, ventilated plastic container. Inside the container is something bright green, slimy, and pulsating. "It’s an alien heart!" Sam yells, stumbling backward into a pile of gardening tools. "It’s not a heart," Maya says, stepping closer with her Polaroid camera. She snaps a photo. As the picture develops, the flash reveals the truth. It’s a giant, wobbling mound of lime-flavored gelatin with plastic fruit suspended inside. "It’s a Jell-O mold?" you ask, disappointed. "Wait," Maya says, pointing to a tag on the container. Property of Oakhaven Science Gala. Category: Structural Integrity of Polymers. "He’s using Jell-O to teach about polymers," you groan. "The 'wrong color' Mrs. Higgins mentioned... she probably wanted red for the gala theme." Suddenly, the basement door at the top of the stairs creaks. A shadow stretches across the floor. TURN TO PAGE 30.
Page 28
"The arcade," you decide. "Toby is more important than whatever 'specimen' Mrs. Higgins is talking about." You slip out the back door, staying low behind the overgrown hedges. Galaxy Games is located at the edge of the downtown strip. It’s been closed for a month for 'renovations,' which in kid-speak means it’s the perfect place for a secret base. As you jog down the alleyway behind the shops, the black van from the school suddenly turns the corner. It’s moving slowly, its headlights off. "Into the dumpsters!" you hiss. The three of you dive behind a large metal bin smelling of old pizza and damp cardboard. The van stops right in front of you. The driver’s side window rolls down. A man leans out. He’s wearing a dark suit and sunglasses—even though it’s cloudy. He holds up a photo. You can’t see the face, but you see the hair. It’s Toby’s messy blonde mop. "He’s heading for the rendezvous point," the man says into a headset. "Intercept him before he reaches the others." The van roars to life and speeds toward the arcade. "They’re going to get him!" Sam whimpers. "We have to get there first!"
If you take the shortcut through the abandoned subway tunnel, TURN TO PAGE 29.
If you try to outrun the van on your feet, TURN TO PAGE 32.
Page 29
The subway tunnel is dark and smells like rust. It’s been out of use since the eighties, but Toby always told you it led directly under the arcade’s basement. "I have the heavy-duty flashlight," Sam says, pulling a torch the size of a club from his bag. He flicks it on. The beam cuts through the gloom, revealing graffiti and old "No Trespassing" signs. Clang! A sound echoes from deeper in the tunnel. It sounds like metal hitting metal. "Who’s there?" you call out. Your voice bounces off the walls. Then, you hear a rhythmic tapping. Tap. Tap. Tap-tap-tap. "That’s Morse code!" Sam whispers. "Toby taught me this. It means... 'H-E-L-P.'" You run toward the sound. In a small alcove, you find a pile of discarded electronics and a walkie-talkie taped to a pipe. It’s buzzing. "Leo? Is that you?" A voice crackles through the static. It’s Toby! "Toby! Where are you? Are you okay?" "I’m in the arcade’s Prize Vault! They locked me in! You have to—" The signal cuts out. "The Prize Vault?" Maya says. "That’s behind the main counter. We have to get inside." TURN TO PAGE 31.
Page 30
The shadow at the top of the stairs belongs to a woman. She’s wearing a raincoat and carrying a heavy clipboard. "Is someone down there?" she calls out. It’s not Ms. Grimm. It’s Mrs. Gable, the neighbor from next door. She’s the head of the Oakhaven Neighborhood Watch and the scariest woman on Maple Lane. "If she catches us," Sam whispers, "she won't call the police. She’ll call our moms." You look around the basement. There’s a coal chute that leads to the side yard, but it’s narrow and covered in soot. Or, you could hide behind the furnace and hope she doesn't come all the way down. "I’m checking the meter!" Mrs. Gable announces, her boots clomping down the first few steps.
If you scramble up the coal chute, TURN TO PAGE 33.
If you hide behind the furnace, TURN TO PAGE 34.
Page 31
You reach the back entrance of Galaxy Games. The "Closed for Renovation" sign hangs crookedly on the door. You nudge it, and it's unlocked. Inside, the arcade is a graveyard of neon lights and silent machines. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Skee-Ball machines stand like frozen statues. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and floor wax. "Toby?" you whisper. "Over here!" A muffled voice comes from behind the Prize Counter—a glass-walled room filled with stuffed animals, cheap plastic rings, and the "Big Prizes" like mountain bikes and game consoles. You rush to the counter. Toby is sitting on a pile of oversized teddy bears, looking more annoyed than scared. He’s eating a bag of nacho cheese chips. "Toby! You’re alive!" Sam cries, throwing his arms around the glass. "Of course I’m alive," Toby says, crunching on a chip. "But I’m 'interned.' That’s a fancy word for trapped. I saw what they did, Leo. I saw the delivery." "The 'Specimen'?" Maya asks. "No," Toby says, his face turning serious. "The cages. Huge ones. They moved them into the school gym under the cover of darkness. And Mr. Henderson... he was leading them."

You sprint down the sidewalk, your lungs burning. The black van is just a block ahead, parked at the curb in front of the arcade. "Look!" Maya points. Two men in suits are hauling a large, heavy crate out of the back of the van. It’s marked with a biohazard symbol. They’re struggling with the weight. "That’s it!" Sam says. "That’s the 'Project'! They’re bringing it into the arcade to hide it!" One of the men trips, and the crate hits the sidewalk with a loud thump. The lid pops open slightly. You expect to see glowing green ooze or a robotic arm. Instead, a mountain of bright orange flyers spills out. "Flyers?" you mutter. You creep closer, hiding behind a parked car. You snag one of the papers as the wind blows it toward you. GRAND OPENING: OAKHAVEN ANIMAL SHELTER GALA! Featuring Mr. Henderson’s 'Science of Fluff' Exhibit! "An animal shelter?" Maya asks. "The 'Project' is a charity event for dogs and cats?" "Wait," you say, looking at the biohazard symbol on the crate. Underneath, in small letters, it says: Warning: Extremely Potent Catnip. "So the 'Specimen'..." Sam begins. "Is probably just a fancy cat," you finish. But then, you hear a scream from inside the arcade. It’s Toby. TURN TO PAGE 35.

"Coal chute! Go!" you hiss. You hoist Maya up first. She disappears into the dark, narrow tunnel, her sneakers kicking up a cloud of black dust. Then you shove Sam upward. He grunts and groans, his backpack getting stuck twice, but finally, he’s through. You grab the ledge and pull yourself up. It’s a tight fit, and the soot gets into your eyes and nose. You crawl upward, feeling like a chimney sweep from a Victorian novel. You pop out into the fresh air of the side yard just as Mrs. Gable reaches the bottom of the basement stairs. "Arthur?" she calls out. "I’m letting the plumber in now!" You roll onto the grass, covered from head to toe in black soot. Sam looks like a charcoal drawing of himself. "We look like ninjas," Sam says, trying to be optimistic. "We look like we fell down a chimney," Maya corrects him, wiping her face. "But look—the black van is leaving Mr. Henderson’s house. It’s heading toward the hospital." "The hospital?" you ask. "Why would a catnip delivery go to the hospital?" "Maybe it’s not catnip," Maya says grimly. "Let's follow them." TURN TO PAGE 38.
Page 34
"Hide!" you whisper. You and the others scramble behind the massive, ancient furnace. It’s warm and smells like burning oil. You press your backs against the metal, trying to be as small as possible. Mrs. Gable’s boots stop right in front of the furnace. You can see her sensible loafers through the gap in the metal. "Honestly, Arthur," she mutters to herself. "Leaving the lights on. Leaving sourdough in the bread maker. It’s like he vanished into thin air." She reaches out and grabs a clipboard hanging on the side of the furnace. "What’s this? 'Operation: Fluffy'? 'Phase One: The Capture'? Oh, for heaven’s sake. He’s taking those stray cats too seriously again." She sighs and turns around, heading back upstairs. "I’ll just lock the door. He’s probably at the clinic getting his shots." The door slams and the lock clicks. "We’re locked in," Sam says, his voice rising in panic. "We’re trapped in the 'Cat-Napper’s' lair!" "Calm down," Maya says. "Look at the 'Operation: Fluffy' notes. There’s a map of the arcade. There’s a big 'X' over the Prize Vault."

You dash into the arcade. The scream came from the back, near the Laser Tag arena. "Toby!" you yell. You find him standing in the middle of the neon-lit arena. He’s staring at a giant, towering figure draped in a white sheet. The figure is moving, making a low, growling sound. "It’s a monster!" Toby yells, backing away. "It’s a seven-foot-tall swamp beast!" Sam grabs a plastic laser tag vest and puts it on. "I’ll distract it! You guys save Toby!" The "beast" lunges forward. The sheet falls off. It’s not a monster. It’s a giant, motorized statue of a golden retriever holding a test tube. It’s part of the Science Gala display. Mr. Henderson is standing behind it with a remote control, looking confused. "Kids?" Mr. Henderson asks, blinking. "What are you doing here? And why is Sam wearing a vest that says 'Commander Sparkles'?" "Mr. Henderson!" you shout. "We thought you were kidnapped! We thought the lab was testing on Toby!" Mr. Henderson laughs, a warm, bumbling sound. "Kidnapped? No, no. I had an emergency appendectomy last night! I’ve been at the Oakhaven Clinic. I just got released to help set up the Animal Shelter Gala." TURN TO PAGE 39.
Page 36
"The year the arcade opened?" Sam says, tapping his chin. "Galaxy Games was founded in 1984. My dad says it was the same year he finally beat the high score on Donkey Kong." You punch 1-9-8-4 into the keypad on the Prize Vault. BEEP. A red light flashes. "Try 1-9-8-2," Toby suggests through the glass. "That’s when the 'Great Arcade Boom' happened. I read it on a wiki page." You try 1-9-8-2. BEEP. Another red light. Suddenly, a loud, grinding noise echoes from the front of the arcade. The heavy security shutter is beginning to close. Someone is locking the building from the outside! "We’re going to be trapped in here until the Grand Opening!" Sam yells. "I can’t survive on nacho cheese chips and stuffed animals!" "The code!" Maya shouts over the noise of the shutter. "Look at the floor!" You look down. Scrawled in the dust near the keypad are four numbers: 0-0-0-0.
If you try "0-0-0-0," TURN TO PAGE 42.
If you ignore the keypad and try to jam the security shutter with a Skee-Ball, TURN TO PAGE 43.
Page 37
"The Manager’s Office is our best bet," you say. "There’s always a master key." You, Sam, and Maya run toward the back of the arcade. The office door is labeled MR. DREECK - NO ADMITTANCE. You push it open. The room is cluttered with broken joysticks and piles of tickets. On the desk is a ledger titled THE HIT LIST. "A hit list!" Sam gasps. "I knew it! The arcade is a front for an international syndicate!" Maya flips the ledger open. "Sam, look at the names. 'T-Bone,' 'Z-Man,' 'The King.' These aren't targets. These are the high scores for Pac-Man." "Oh," Sam says, deflating. "Well, that’s... less scary." You find a heavy brass key hanging on a hook labeled VAULT. But as you grab it, you notice a monitor on the desk. It’s a security feed of the school parking lot. The black van is there, and Ms. Grimm is talking to the driver. She’s pointing toward the arcade. "They’re coming here," you say. "They know we escaped." TURN TO PAGE 44.
Page 38
You follow the black van as it pulls into the Oakhaven Community Clinic. The men in suits hop out, but they aren't carrying weapons. They’re carrying a bouquet of balloons that say GET WELL SOON. "Balloons?" Sam asks. "Maybe they’re filled with sleeping gas? Or... or truth serum?" You sneak into the clinic through the ambulance bay. You see the men enter Room 204. You creep down the hallway and peek through the small window in the door. Inside, Mr. Henderson is sitting in a hospital bed. He’s wearing a thin blue gown and eating a bowl of green Jell-O. He looks pale, but he’s laughing. "Thank you for the delivery, boys," Mr. Henderson says to the men. "Did the 'Specimen' make it to the school safely?" "Yes, sir," one of the men says. "The prize-winning Jell-O mold for the Gala is in your basement. And the catnip is at the arcade." You stand frozen in the hallway. The "Shadowy Men" are just Mr. Henderson’s brothers, who run a local delivery service. "I’m going to go home and hide under my bed for a year," Sam whispers. "We broke into a teacher’s house to find... dessert." TURN TO PAGE 45.
Page 39
"So... let me get this straight," you say, looking at Mr. Henderson and the giant dog statue. "You had surgery. Your brothers delivered Jell-O. And Toby was just hiding because he thought he saw a 'secret weapon' that was actually a robot dog?" "That's about the size of it," Mr. Henderson says, ruffling Toby’s hair. "I’m sorry I worried you all. I didn't have time to call because everything happened so fast." "But what about Ms. Grimm?" Maya asks. "And the lockdown? And the 'Assets'?" Mr. Henderson chuckles. "Ms. Grimm is a retired librarian. She’s a bit stern, yes. And the lockdown? A stray dog got into the ventilation system. The Principal ordered a 'Soft Lockdown' until the beekeeper arrived. You three weren't 'Assets.' You were just... students who needed to stay in your seats." The silence in the arcade is heavy. You feel about two inches tall. You’ve spent the day breaking windows, sneaking through coal chutes, and dodging "secret agents" who were just trying to deliver party supplies.

"The real Toby!" you yell, running toward a figure huddled in the corner of the arcade’s basement. The figure turns around. It’s Toby, but he’s wearing a giant, fuzzy cat head. "Toby? Why are you a cat?" you ask. Toby pulls the mask off. He’s sweating. "I’m the mascot! Mr. Henderson promised me ten extra credit points if I dressed up as 'Professor Paws' for the Animal Shelter Gala. But the mask got stuck, and then I heard you guys breaking in and I thought you were the 'Organization' coming to take me away!" "We were coming to save you!" Sam yells. "Save me from what?" Toby asks. "The buffet? I’ve been eating free Science Gala brownies for two hours." You look at Sam. Sam looks at Maya. Maya looks at the broken window and the soot on your clothes. "We might have overthought this," you admit.

"I’m picking the lock," you say, kneeling by the basement door. "It’s our only way out before the 'Project' begins." You use the tension wrench from your multi-tool. Your hands are shaking, which makes it harder. Click. Clack. "Hurry!" Sam hisses. "I hear footsteps!" The door suddenly swings inward—not because you picked it, but because someone opened it from the other side. You tumble forward, landing at the feet of a pair of sensible loafers. It’s the Principal. He’s holding a tray of coffee. "I was wondering where you three went. Ms. Grimm said you vanished through the window." "We can explain!" you shout. "The lab! The AEGIS Project! The brainwashing!" The Principal stares at you. He looks at your soot-stained faces and the "Operation: Fluffy" notes in your hand. He sighs and takes a sip of his coffee. "Leo, that isn't a brainwashing project. It’s the name of the local cat rescue. Mr. Henderson is the treasurer. And you’re currently standing in his laundry room."

You punch 0-0-0-0 into the keypad. CLICK. The Prize Vault door swings open. "Toby! Run!" you yell. Toby leaps off the teddy bears and sprints out of the vault just as the arcade’s front security shutter hits the floor with a heavy THUD. You’re all trapped inside, but at least you’re together. "Okay," Toby says, catching his breath. "I have a confession. The note? 'I saw what they did'? I was talking about the cafeteria ladies. They were putting raisins in the cookies. I was trying to warn you before lunch." Sam stares at him. "The raisins? We escaped school, dodged a 'government' van, and broke into an arcade... because of raisins?" "They were a lot of raisins, Sam," Toby says defensively. Suddenly, the lights in the arcade flicker and turn on. Music starts to play—the theme from Donkey Kong. A voice comes over the intercom. "Test sequence complete. The Oakhaven Science Gala is ready for guests!"
TURN TO PAGE 63 FOR THE "ACCIDENTAL GUESTS" ENDING.

"Sam, give me a Skee-Ball!" you yell. Sam hands you a heavy wooden ball. You hurl it toward the closing security shutter. It wedges underneath the metal lip, causing the motor to groan and spark. The shutter stops, leaving a two-foot gap at the bottom. "Go! Crawl!" The four of you scramble under the gate and burst out onto the sidewalk. You keep running until you reach the park, hiding behind a row of oak trees. "We made it," you pant. "We escaped the lab." "Um, Leo?" Maya points back toward the arcade. A giant banner is being unfurled by the men in suits. It says: WELCOME TO THE 15TH ANNUAL CHARITY PET-A-THON. Below the banner, Mr. Henderson is waving at the crowd. He has a bandage on his stomach and is holding a very small, very cute kitten. "I think," Sam says, leaning his head against a tree, "that we might be the least legendary detectives in history."

You grab the brass key and run back to the Prize Vault. You shove the key into the lock and turn it. "Toby! Get out of there!" Toby stumbles out, blinking in the dim light. "Leo? What are you doing here? Is the 'Project' over?" "It’s not a project, Toby! It’s a trap! The van is outside!" You lead the group to the back exit, but the door is blocked by the black van. The driver gets out. He’s holding a clipboard. "Excuse me," the man says. "Are you the students Mr. Henderson mentioned? The ones who were supposed to help with the 'Science of Fluff' exhibit?" You stop. "The what?" "The exhibit," the man says, confused. "I’m with the Oakhaven Courier. We’re here to take photos of the kids helping with the animal rescue fundraiser. But you all look like... well, you look like you’ve been through a war zone." "It was a very intense mystery," you say, trying to maintain your dignity despite the soot on your nose.
TURN TO PAGE 65 FOR THE "FRONT PAGE NEWS" ENDING.
Page 45
"If Mr. Henderson is in the hospital," Maya whispers, "then who is driving that van?" You look out the clinic window. The black van has pulled up to the curb. The side door slides open. A woman steps out. She’s wearing a white lab coat and carrying a high-tech-looking scanner. She walks up to Toby’s bike, which is still lying on the sidewalk where you left it. She scans the handlebars, and the machine in her hand beeps aggressively. "Signal confirmed," she says into a radio. "The biological tracking tag is active. The subject is nearby." "Biological tracking tag?" Sam says, his voice hitting a high squeak. "They tagged Toby! He’s like a migratory bird or a shark!" You look back at Room 204. Mr. Henderson is being wheeled out by a nurse for an X-ray. The "Shadowy Men" are busy talking to the receptionist about a parking ticket. "This is it," you say, grabbing your bag. "The real organization. They aren't here for Henderson. They’re here for us."
If you confront the woman in the lab coat, TURN TO PAGE 46.
If you try to sneak into the back of the van to find the "tracking data," TURN TO PAGE 47.
Page 46
"Hey!" you yell, marching out of the clinic doors. "We know what you’re doing! We know about the tags!" The woman in the lab coat freezes. She looks at you, then at Sam (who is holding his walkie-talkie like a weapon), then at Maya (who is snapping Polaroids). "Excuse me?" the woman says. She has a badge that reads Dr. Aris, Oakhaven Veterinary Services. "The tracking tag!" you point to the scanner. "You’re tracking my friend Toby!" Dr. Aris blinks. Then, she looks down at the scanner. "I’m tracking a Microchip #882-B. It’s a very rare Himalayan cat that escaped from the grooming salon this morning. I’m getting a signal from... well, from those handlebars." You look at Toby’s bike. There, caught in the rubber grip of the handlebar, is a tuft of long, white fur. "Shadow," Maya whispers. "Toby’s cat must have rubbed against the bike. He’s the one with the chip." "So you aren't... a secret agent?" Sam asks, lowering his walkie-talkie. "I’m a vet," she says slowly. "Are you children... okay? You’re covered in soot." TURN TO PAGE 48.
Page 47
"We need that data," you whisper. While the woman is busy scanning the bike, you and the group circle around to the back of the van. The door is slightly ajar. You slip inside. The back of the van is filled with stainless steel cages. In the center is a large computer terminal displaying a map of the city. A blinking red dot is moving rapidly toward the local park. "There he is!" Sam says. "The Subject! He’s moving at thirty miles per hour! They’re transporting him!" "Wait," Maya says, squinting at the screen. "The subject’s name is listed as 'Snowball.' Since when is Toby’s code name 'Snowball'?" Suddenly, the van door slams shut. CLACK. "Oh no," Sam moans. "We’ve been 'asset-napped'!" The van starts to move. You’re tossed against a stack of empty pet carriers. "We have to escape!" you yell.

You stand on the sidewalk, feeling the cold realization wash over you. There is no secret lab. There is no AEGIS project. "Mr. Henderson had surgery," Maya recaps, counting on her fingers. "The 'Shadowy Men' are his brothers delivering party snacks. The 'Black Van' is a pet transport. And the 'Tracking Signal' is a lost cat." "And Toby?" Sam asks. "He’s at the arcade eating chips." "We’re just... kids who skipped school and broke into a house for no reason," you say. Just then, a police cruiser pulls up to the curb. The officer rolls down the window. It’s Officer Miller, the school resource officer. "Well, well," he says. "The Principal said three of his students vanished out a window. And here you are, covered in coal dust and harassing the local vet." "Officer, we thought there was a conspiracy!" Sam blurs out. Officer Miller sighs. "The only conspiracy here is how I’m going to explain this to your parents. Get in the car."

THUD! THUD! You and Sam kick the back doors with all your might. On the third kick, the latch gives way. The doors fly open while the van is still moving at twenty miles per hour! "Jump!" Maya yells. The three of you tumble out of the van and roll onto the soft grass of the Oakhaven Park. You come to a stop near a group of toddlers who are staring at you in shock. The van screeches to a halt. Dr. Aris runs out. "Are you kids insane?! You could have been killed!" "We were looking for Toby!" you yell, standing up and brushing grass off your jeans. "I'm right here!" You turn around. Toby is standing by the duck pond. He’s holding a very fluffy, very angry-looking white cat. "I found Snowball!" Toby says proudly. "I saw her running through the woods earlier. I followed her here to make sure she was safe. I knew the vet was looking for her." You look at Toby. You look at the vet. You look at your scraped knees. "You followed a cat?" you ask. "All day?" "Yeah," Toby says. "What did you guys do?"

"I'm going through the partition," you say. Sam hands you the screwdriver. You quickly remove the screws holding the wire mesh in place. You squeeze through the gap and tumble into the front seat—directly into the lap of the woman in the lab coat. "AHHH!" she screams, slamming on the brakes. The van skids to a stop. "Who are you?! Why are you in my van?!" "We’re the Detective Club!" Sam yells from the back. "And we surrender! Just don't use the mind-control rays!" The woman stares at you. She looks at your soot-stained faces. "Mind-control rays? I’m an intern for the Oakhaven Zoo. I’m just trying to deliver these empty cages for the fundraiser." She pulls over and opens the back door. "Out. All of you. Now." As you climb out, you see Toby walking down the street, waving a flyer. "Hey guys! Check it out! I got a job as the official photographer for the Science Gala! Mr. Henderson set it up before he went to the hospital!"

Despite the vet’s explanation, you still feel like something is off. "If Toby is just 'Snowball,' then why did Ms. Grimm lock the classroom?" you ask. "Because of the bees," a voice says. You turn around. It’s Mr. Pike, the janitor. He’s standing by his maintenance truck. "A swarm of Africanized honeybees settled in the oak tree right outside your classroom window. The Principal ordered a 'Soft Lockdown' until the beekeeper arrived." "Bees?" Sam asks. "Not... 'Assets'?" "He said 'Assess the assets,'" Mr. Pike clarifies. "He meant the science equipment. He didn't want the bees getting into the vents and ruining the expensive microscopes." You look at the ground. You’ve spent the whole day running from a science teacher, a librarian, and a few thousand bees. TURN TO PAGE 73 FOR THE "STUNG BY EMBARRASSMENT" ENDING.

"We should go back," you say quietly. "If we turn ourselves in now, maybe the Principal will be lenient." The walk back to Oakhaven Elementary feels like a mile. When you arrive, the "Black Van" is parked in the circle drive, but now it has a magnetic sign on the side: BARB’S BARKERY - DOG TREATS & MORE. You walk into the front office. Ms. Grimm is there, talking to the Principal. She looks relieved to see you. "There they are!" she says. "The three who jumped! I told you they were just worried about their friend." "Students," the Principal says, crossing his arms. "Do you have any idea how much trouble you’re in? We had to call the police. We had to call your parents." "We thought it was a conspiracy," you whisper. "The only conspiracy," the Principal says, "is how we’re going to clean up the mess you made. You’re all assigned to the 'Gala Cleanup Crew.' Every Saturday. For a month." TURN TO PAGE 74 FOR THE "CLEANUP CREW" ENDING.
Page 53
You sit in the Principal’s office, the weight of your choices finally settling in. Your parents have been called, and the look on the Principal's face suggests that "The Project" is the least of your worries. "Skipping school is a serious offense," Mr. Hallowell says. "But jumping out of a second-story window? That is a matter of safety." Sam looks like he’s about to cry. Maya is staring at a crack in the ceiling, her jaw set. You realize that in your quest to be heroes, you forgot that the real world has rules—and those rules usually involve being grounded until you’re eighteen.
Page 54
"Wait," you say, trying to find a silver lining. "What about 'Operation: Fluffy'?" The Principal pauses, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Operation: Fluffy was Mr. Henderson’s name for the stray cat rescue initiative. He was very passionate about it. He spent months planning this gala, and now, thanks to his surgery, it’s up to the rest of the staff to pull it off." He leans forward. "It seems you three have a lot of energy. Energy that could be spent setting up chairs and folding flyers. If you help us make this Gala a success, I might—might—talk to your parents about reducing your suspension."
Page 55
The transition from "Investigator" to "Volunteer" is a humbling one. You are handed a stack of bright orange flyers and a roll of masking tape. "We need these on every telephone pole within a six-block radius," Mrs. Higgins tells you. As you walk out the front doors of the school, you see Toby’s cat, Shadow, sitting on the wall. He looks at you, lets out a bored yawn, and starts licking his paw. "He’s mocking us," Sam mutters. "I’m ninety percent sure that cat just laughed at me." You look at the flyers in your hand. THE VANISHING OF ROOM 4B was just a really poorly timed science fundraiser.
Page 56
The walk from the Oakhaven Community Clinic back to the school feels like a march toward your doom. You are covered in coal soot from the chute, Maya has mulch in her hair from the window jump, and Sam is still clutching a walkie-talkie that has done nothing but broadcast static all day. As you reach the school gates, the "Black Van" is parked right at the front. But the "agents" aren't guarding it with sunglasses. Instead, they are unloading a crate of folding chairs and a giant inflatable puppy. "Look at that," Maya says, her voice flat. "The 'Biological Asset' is a bouncy castle."
Page 57
"The Detective Club, I presume?" Mr. Hallowell asks, crossing his arms. "The students who turned a simple 'soft lockdown' into a city-wide scavenger hunt?" "We can explain, sir!" Sam blurted out. "We thought Mr. Henderson was being held in a secret basement! We thought the 'Project' was a government experiment!" Mr. Hallowell stares at you for a long time. "Students, Mr. Henderson is in the hospital because his appendix decided to retire early. The 'Project' is the Oakhaven Animal Shelter Fundraiser. And the 'Assets' were the expensive virtual reality goggles the district just bought. We didn't want the beekeeper’s smoke to ruin the lenses."

"We'll do catering!" you say, thinking of the "Science Brownies" you found earlier. Mr. Hallowell leads you to the school's home-economics room. Waiting there is a very tired-looking Mrs. Higgins and about fifty pounds of raw dough. "Since you three were so busy 'investigating' Mr. Henderson's house," Mrs. Higgins says, pointing to the ovens, "you can finish the 'Sourdough Science' exhibit. We need 200 mini-loaves shaped like kittens by tonight." For the next four hours, you don't fight agents. You fight gluten. Your hands are sticky, and the flour makes you sneeze.
Page 59
"We'll do publicity!" Maya says. Mr. Hallowell nods and leads you to the gym. "Toby is already there. He needs help with the costumes." In the gym, you find Toby. He’s trying to put on a giant, fuzzy suit that looks like a cross between a Golden Retriever and a scientist. "Meet 'Doctor Doggo,'" Toby says, his voice muffled by a massive plush head. "The head of the fundraiser. The fan in the suit is broken, and it’s about a hundred degrees in here." "The job," Mr. Hallowell says, "is for one of you to wear the suit and greet people at the door."
Page 60
"We'll handle the press," you say, trying to sound professional. "Excellent," Mr. Hallowell says. "The Oakhaven Gazette is outside. Go tell them all about the 'dedication' of the students at this school." You walk out to the curb where a reporter named Ms. Gable is waiting. "Oh! You're the ones!" she says. "The ones who thought the school was a secret lab? My aunt told me all about your 'investigation' in Mr. Henderson’s basement." "It was a misunderstanding!" Sam squeaks. "Nonsense!" Ms. Gable laughs. "It’s a great story! 'Local Kids Protect School from Imaginary Spies.' Hold still for a photo."
Page 61
By 6:00 PM, the "Science of Bread" table is a disaster. Half the loaves are burnt, and the other half look like they were sat on by an elephant. Mr. Henderson arrives in a wheelchair, pushed by his brothers. He looks at your flour-covered faces and the lumpy bread. "Well," he says, taking a bite. "It’s... crunchy." "We’re sorry about the brownies, Mr. Henderson," you say. "Don't worry about it," he chuckles. "The Science Gala is a success! We raised enough money for ten new kennels. And honestly? This sourdough is a great lesson in what happens when you don't follow instructions."
THE END: THE SOURDOUGH ENDING.
Page 62
The "Doctor Doggo" suit is even heavier than it looks. You spend the entire evening standing by the front door, waving a giant plush paw at parents and toddlers. It’s so hot inside the suit that you’re pretty sure your brain is starting to melt. "Look, Mommy! A giant puppy!" a little boy yells, kicking you in the shin. "Ow," you mutter into the plush muzzle. "I mean... Woof! Science is fun!" Through the mesh eye-holes, you see Sam and Maya laughing as they hand out stickers. By the time you finally take the head off at 9:00 PM, you're drenched in sweat, but you helped raise five hundred dollars for the dogs.
THE END: THE MASCOT ENDING.
Page 63
The next morning, you find the Oakhaven Gazette sitting on the porch. There, on the front page, is a giant photo of you, Sam, and Maya. You are covered in soot, Sam is holding his walkie-talkie, and you all look incredibly guilty. The headline reads: LOCAL "DETECTIVES" UNCOVER WORLD'S TASTIEST CONSPIRACY. The article describes how you mistook a bread maker for a DNA centrifuge. Your gym teacher calls you "Agent Leo" for the rest of the week. "Well," Maya says. "On the bright side, the Animal Shelter got so much publicity that they had to open a second location."
THE END: THE FRONT PAGE ENDING.
Page 64
As the Gala winds down, you find Toby sitting by the Skee-Ball machines. "Hey Toby," you say. "What did you actually see? The thing that made you write the note 'I saw what they did'?" Toby looks around to make sure no adults are listening. "I saw Mr. Henderson and the Principal in the teacher’s lounge," he whispers. "They were eating the good pizza. The stuff from Tony's Italian with the stuffed crust. Not the cardboard pizza they give us on Fridays. They didn't share, Leo! It was a betrayal of the highest order!" You, Sam, and Maya look at each other and start laughing.
THE END: THE TOBY REVELATION.
Page 65
You stand at the back of the room, watching Mr. Henderson do a "Science of Bubbles" demonstration. The "Secret Lab" doesn't exist. The "Agents" are just neighbors. And your friend group is safe and sound. You realize that sometimes, the world isn't out to get you. Sometimes, life is just a series of funny misunderstandings and really good sourdough bread. "So," Sam asks, "what are we doing next Monday?" "Math," you say. "Just regular, boring math." "Sounds perfect," Maya agrees.

Monday morning arrives with a heavy sense of reality. You, Sam, and Maya are back in your seats in Room 4B. The coal soot is mostly scrubbed off your faces, though Sam still has a faint grey smudge behind his left ear. The classroom feels different. The "eerie" silence from last Tuesday is gone, replaced by the normal sounds of Oakhaven Elementary: a radiator clanking, someone dropping a highlighter, and the distant sound of the gym teacher’s whistle. Ms. Grimm is still at the front of the room. She isn’t drawing mysterious circles today. She’s grading papers with a very regular-looking purple pen.
Page 67
Suddenly, the door opens. It isn’t a man in a suit. It’s Mr. Henderson. He’s leaning on a cane and wearing a bowtie with tiny stethoscopes on it. The whole class erupts into cheers. "Alright, alright! Settle down, my fellow scientists!" he says. "I want to thank everyone who helped out with the Animal Shelter Gala. Especially our... most enthusiastic investigators." He looks directly at you and winks. "Now," Mr. Henderson continues, "we’re going to study the history of Cryptography and Code-breaking." Toby pumps his fist in the air. "Yes!" But then, you notice something. As Mr. Henderson sits down, a small, black device falls out of his pocket. It hits the floor with a metallic clink and starts to glow with a faint, pulsing blue light.
If you point it out to him, TURN TO PAGE 68.
If you keep quiet, TURN TO PAGE 69.
Page 68
"Mr. Henderson?" you say, pointing to the floor. "You dropped your... your glowing blue thing." The room goes silent. Mr. Henderson looks down and laughs. He picks up the device. "Oh, this? It’s a high-tech laser pointer. One of my brothers—the 'mysterious' delivery drivers you met—got it for me. It has a built-in gyroscope so it stays steady even if my hands are shaking from the surgery." He flicks a switch, and a tiny red dot appears on the chalkboard. "See? No secret weapons here. Just the latest in classroom technology." You sink back into your chair. "Don't worry, Leo," Mr. Henderson says softly. "The world is full of real mysteries. You don't have to go looking for the fake ones." TURN TO PAGE 70.
Page 69
You look at the glowing device. You look at Sam’s terrified expression. You look at the scratch on your arm from the coal chute. Nope, you think. I am done. You turn your head and focus intensely on page 158 of your science textbook. Whatever that blue thing is, you don’t want to know. If it’s a portal to another dimension, they can send a postcard. If it’s a mind-control remote, you’re happy to be controlled into doing your homework. "Wise choice," Maya whispers, seeing you look away. For the first time in a week, you feel completely normal. And honestly? Normal feels pretty good. TURN TO PAGE 70.

Lunchtime. The four of you are sitting at your usual table. Toby has brought a large box from Tony's Italian. "The Good Pizza!" Toby announces. "My mom felt bad that I got trapped in an arcade." As you eat, you look around the cafeteria. Everything is exactly as it should be. The lunch lady is ladling mystery gravy, and the Principal is reminding kids not to run. "We were pretty ridiculous, weren't we?" Sam asks. "We were legendary," Maya corrects him. "Most kids just go to school. We went on an epic quest to save a teacher who was already being saved by doctors." "To the Detective Club," you say, holding up a juice box. THE END.

Even though you didn't uncover a global conspiracy, the school actually did give you a reward. Because the "Detective Club" technically advertised the Gala so much during your "investigation," the Animal Shelter raised a record-breaking $5,000. In the lobby of the school, there is now a small plaque next to the trophy case: HONORARY VOLUNTEERS: LEO, SAM, MAYA, AND TOBY. "For their unparalleled imagination and dedication to the 'Project'." It’s not a medal for bravery, but it’s the only trophy in the school that was won by mistake. TURN TO PAGE 74.

You’ve reached the end of the mundane path. But your mind wanders back to that first choice. What if you hadn't gone to the house? What if the school was hiding something under the floorboards? What if the Forbidden Woods weren't just full of trees, but full of something... older? The story you just read was the "Overzealous" version. But Oakhaven Elementary has many secrets. Are you ready to see a darker side of Room 4B?

You decide the answer is right under your feet. You don’t climb out the window. You don't look at the woods. You wait for Ms. Grimm to turn her back, and you signal to Sam and Maya. "The boiler room," you whisper. "Toby’s map showed an extra floor. 'The Cooler.' If he’s there, he’s in trouble." You slip out of your seat and crawl toward the door. The hallway is empty, but the lights are flickering. You reach the heavy steel door labeled MAINTENANCE ONLY. As you pull it open, a blast of cold, sterilized air hits you. This doesn't smell like a school basement. It smells like a hospital. You look at the elevator. There is a small, digital keypad that wasn't there yesterday. Below the button for the 1st Floor and the Basement, there is a glowing blue button labeled: LEVEL -2. "We shouldn't be here," Sam whispers. "Too late now," Maya says, pointing to the security camera that just swiveled to face you.
TURN TO PAGE 76.
Page 76
The elevator doors hiss shut with a sound like a hydraulic press. There are no buttons inside—just a smooth, brushed-steel panel and a small speaker. "Maybe we should get out," Sam whispers, his thumb hovering over his walkie-talkie. "My gut says this isn't where they keep the extra dodgeballs." Suddenly, the floor drops. It’s not the gentle descent of a normal elevator; it’s a fast, stomach-churning plunge. The digital display above the door flickers. B… G… -1… and then, a glowing red -2. The doors slide open. The air that hits you is freezing. Gone are the beige brick walls and the smell of floor wax. Instead, you are staring down a long, white corridor illuminated by recessed blue lights. At the end of the hall, a large logo is etched into the wall: a shield with an eye in the center. Underneath it, the letters read: A.E.G.I.S. (Advanced Educational Genetic Integrated Systems). "Genetic systems?" Maya breathes. "Leo, this isn't a school. It’s a farm." TURN TO PAGE 77.
Page 77
You step out onto the polished floor. It’s so clean you can see your reflection—a dirty, terrified kid in a school hoodie who looks completely out of place. "Look," Maya points to a directory on the wall. LEVEL -2: RESEARCH & ACQUISITION. Sector 1: Cognitive Testing. Sector 2: Neural Mapping. Sector 3: The Cooler (Long-term Storage). "The Cooler," you mutter, pulling Toby’s crumpled drawing from your pocket. "That’s where he said Mr. Henderson went. That’s where they’re keeping him." Suddenly, a rhythmic clack-clack-clack echoes from around the corner. It’s the sound of hard-soled boots on tile. "Someone’s coming!" Sam hisses. You look around. To your left is a door labeled CLOSET - SANITATION UNITS. To your right is a heavy set of double doors labeled DATA ARCHIVE.
If you duck into the Sanitation Closet, TURN TO PAGE 78.
If you try to hide in the Data Archive, TURN TO PAGE 79.
Page 78
You shove Sam and Maya into the sanitation closet and pull the door shut just as the footsteps reach the hallway. Through the narrow slat in the door, you see them. It’s not Ms. Grimm. It’s two men in tactical gear with the AEGIS logo on their shoulders. But it’s the third person that makes your blood run cold. It’s a student. A girl from the eighth grade named Brenda. But she isn't walking like Brenda. She’s staring straight ahead, her eyes glassy and vacant. She’s wearing a thin, silver band around her temples that pulses with a rhythmic violet light. "Asset 44 is showing a 15% increase in processing speed," one of the guards says. "The serum is holding. Move her to the testing bay." Brenda follows them like a zombie. "They're brainwashing them," Sam whispers. "They're using the honor roll kids as test subjects." In the closet, you realize you're leaning against a row of large, white canisters labeled NEURO-MIST: STAGE 4. TURN TO PAGE 80.
Page 79
You dive through the doors of the Data Archive. The room is massive, filled with rows of humming black server towers that stretch toward a high ceiling. The air is even colder here to keep the machines from overheating. "Sam, your time to shine," you say, gesturing to the nearest console. Sam fumbles with his gear, pulling out a specialized hacking cable. "I hope their firewall is as old as the school’s wifi," he mutters. His fingers fly across the keys. A map of the facility appears on the screen. "Okay, I've got it. 'The Cooler' isn't just a room. It’s a cryogenic holding bay. They freeze people whose brains are 'incompatible' with the serum." "Look at the active files!" Maya says, pointing to a flashing red icon. The screen shows a photo of Toby. Underneath it: SUBJECT 109 - TOBY MILLER. STATUS: PENDING EVALUATION. DISPOSITION: UNCOOPERATIVE. "They're going to put him in the Cooler," you say. "We have to get to Sector 3." TURN TO PAGE 81.
Page 80
The closet is cramped. As you move to get a better look at the canisters, Sam’s backpack bumps into a mop bucket. CLANG. The footsteps in the hallway stop instantly. "Check the closet," a voice commands. You look around frantically. There’s a ventilation duct in the ceiling, but it’s high up. Or, you could try to ambush them with a heavy canister of Neuro-Mist. "Leo, the vent!" Maya whispers, cupping her hands to give you a boost.
If you try to scramble into the ventilation duct, TURN TO PAGE 82.
If you prepare to fight back when the door opens, TURN TO PAGE 83.
Page 81
"Wait," Sam says, his eyes fixed on the server screen. "There's a log from Mr. Henderson. He was an AEGIS employee?" You crowd around the monitor. It’s a video file dated yesterday. Mr. Henderson is on screen, but he looks different. He’s not wearing a bowtie; he’s wearing a lab coat. He looks exhausted. "This has gone too far," Henderson says to the camera. "Project Aethelgard was supposed to help kids with learning disabilities, not turn the entire school into a hive-mind. I’ve hidden the override key in the one place they’ll never look—the old boiler in the cafeteria basement. If anyone finds this... God help us." The video cuts to static as the archive doors begin to groan. Someone is trying to override the lock from the outside. "He was trying to stop them," Maya says. "That’s why he vanished."
If you head for Sector 3 to save Toby first, TURN TO PAGE 84.
If you try to get back to the elevator to find the override key in the boiler, TURN TO PAGE 85.
Page 82
You scramble onto Maya’s shoulders and claw at the vent cover. It’s held on by four simple screws. You use your multi-tool to twist them frantically as the door handle begins to turn. One screw... two... "Hurry!" Sam hisses, his face pale. The vent cover pops off. You pull yourself up into the dark, dusty shaft, then reach down to grab Maya’s hand. You haul her up just as the door to the closet swings open. "Empty," the guard grumbles below you. "Just some cleaning supplies. I could have sworn I heard something." You lay flat on the cold metal, your heart hammering against your ribs. The vent leads deeper into the facility. As you crawl forward, you pass over a room with glass ceilings. Inside, you see Mr. Henderson. He’s strapped to a chair, a glowing helmet lowering over his head. "No," you whisper. TURN TO PAGE 86.
Page 83
"We're not running," you whisper, grabbing a heavy canister of Neuro-Mist. "On three, we go low." The door handle turns. The door swings open, and a guard steps inside, his flashlight cutting through the dark. "NOW!" You swing the canister at the guard's shins. He yells in surprise and topples forward. Maya tackles his waist, and Sam grabs the guard's radio, throwing it into the mop bucket. The second guard reaches for his belt, but you spray the Neuro-Mist directly into the air between you. A thick, sweet-smelling cloud erupts. The guard staggers back, his eyes rolling into the back of his head. "I... I forgot... why I'm here..." he mutters, then slumps against the wall, unconscious. "It’s a memory-wiper!" Sam gasps, covering his nose. "We just erased his last ten minutes!" You grab the guard’s keycard. It’s a golden-colored card labeled LEVEL -2 ACCESS: ALL SECTORS. TURN TO PAGE 87.
Page 84
"We can't leave Toby," you say firmly. "If they put him in the Cooler, he might never wake up. The override key can wait." You leave the Data Archive through a back exit and find yourself in a glass-walled bridge overlooking Sector 1. Below you are dozens of cubicles where students are sitting, staring at screens that flash images at high speeds. In the center of the room is a raised platform. Toby is there, surrounded by three scientists in hazmat suits. One of them is holding a long needle filled with a glowing violet liquid. "The serum," Maya whispers. "They're going to inject him." You look at the bridge railing. There’s a fire suppression pipe running along the ceiling. If you could break it, the chaos might give you enough time to reach the floor.
If you break the pipe to cause a distraction, TURN TO PAGE 88.
If you try to sneak down the stairs and use the keycard to stop the injection, TURN TO PAGE 89.
Page 85
"If we get the override key, we can shut down the whole system," you argue. "We can save Toby, Mr. Henderson, and everyone else all at once." "But the elevator is probably guarded now!" Sam points out. You look at the map on the screen. There’s a service lift used for moving large equipment. It’s located in the loading dock, right past the neural mapping lab. "That's our way out," you say. You sprint through the hallways, dodging the scanning beams of ceiling-mounted turrets. You reach the Neural Mapping Lab. Through the window, you see rows of brains in jars, each one connected to a computer. One of the jars has a label that makes your stomach turn: TOBY M. - PRELIMINARY SCAN. "They've already started mapping his brain," Maya says. "Leo, if we leave now, what if there's nothing left of him when we get back?"
If you stay to destroy the mapping data, TURN TO PAGE 90.
If you stick to the plan and head for the lift, TURN TO PAGE 91.
Page 86
You crawl through the narrow, vibrating vent toward the room where Mr. Henderson is being held. The glowing helmet on his head pulses with a sickly violet light, and his face is contorted in a silent grimace. "They’re overwriting his memories," Maya whispers. "Look at the monitor next to him. It’s a progress bar. It says: ERASURE 84%." If that bar hits 100%, the bumbling science teacher you love will be gone, replaced by whatever personality A.E.G.I.S. wants to program into him. You reach a grate directly above the control console. Below you, a single scientist is frantically typing. You notice a red "EMERGENCY STOP" button on the panel, but it’s protected by a glass flip-cover. "I’ll drop down and hit the stop," you say.
If you drop down to hit the Emergency Stop, TURN TO PAGE 92.
If you try to disable the power by cutting the wires through the vent first, TURN TO PAGE 93.
Page 87
With the Golden Keycard in hand, you feel like you have the skeleton key to the entire fortress. You move toward the heavy, reinforced doors of Sector 3: The Cooler. "The keycard should work," Sam says, "but the door has a secondary retinal scanner. One of us is going to have to trick the sensor." Maya looks at the unconscious guard. She takes her Polaroid camera and snaps a high-definition, close-up photo of his eye. As the photo develops, she holds the glossy image up to the scanner. CHIRP. ACCESS GRANTED. The doors hiss open, revealing a room filled with thick, rolling fog. Large, upright cylinders line the walls. Each one contains a person frozen in a block of blue, translucent ice. "These are the failures," Sam whispers. You scan the names on the pods. You see a pod labeled: HENDERSON, A. - RESERVED. TURN TO PAGE 94.
Page 88
"The pipe!" you hiss. You grab the heavy multi-tool and swing it with all your strength at the red fire-suppression valve. CLANG! The metal buckles, and a second later, the pipe bursts. A torrent of high-pressure water and fire-extinguishing foam explodes into the testing bay. The scientists scream as the foam blinds them, and the students in the cubicles start to panic. "Toby!" you yell, leaping over the bridge railing. You land on a soft pile of foam and scramble toward the platform. Toby is struggling against his restraints, the needle just inches from his arm. "Leo? Is that you?" he coughs. You grab a pair of surgical scissors from a nearby tray and start sawing at the leather straps. But from the far end of the room, a door slams open. A squad of "Prefects"—older students with cold, robotic eyes—marches in, holding stun-rods.
If you grab Toby and run for the vents, TURN TO PAGE 95.
If you stand your ground and use the foam to hide your movements, TURN TO PAGE 96.
Page 89
"Keep the keycard ready," you whisper to Sam. The three of you creep down the stairs, staying low behind the row of server towers. You reach the floor just as the Head Scientist—a man with a scar running through his eyebrow—reaches for the injector. "Wait!" you shout, stepping out into the light. The scientist stops, looking amused. "The 'Detective Club.' I was wondering when you'd show up. You’ve been very busy on Level -1." "Let Toby go," you say, trying to keep your voice from shaking. "We have the keycard. We can lock this whole floor down." "Oh, you have the Golden Card?" The scientist smiles thinly. "Then you know how valuable it is. Trade it for your friend. Give me the card, and I’ll let Toby walk out the door."
If you trade the keycard for Toby, TURN TO PAGE 97.
If you try to rush the scientist and tackle him, TURN TO PAGE 98.
Page 90
"We can't let them have his brain," you say. "Sam, fry the circuits." Sam doesn't hesitate. He pulls a powerful magnet from his bag and slams it against the main drive of the neural mapper. ZZZZZT-POP! Blue sparks shower the room. The jar containing the "Preliminary Scan" of Toby's brain begins to hiss as the liquid drains out, the data corrupted beyond repair. "Intruder Alert! Data Breach in Sector 2!" an automated voice booms. "Time to go!" Maya yells. You scramble toward the service lift, but the doors are closing. A hand reaches out and grabs yours—it’s the janitor, Mr. Pike! But he isn't holding a mop. He’s holding a high-tech stun-baton. "Leaving so soon, kids?" he sneers. "The Principal wants a word with you." TURN TO PAGE 99.
Page 91
The service lift is a large, industrial platform meant for heavy crates. You pull the lever, and it begins to grind upward. "We’re going to the boiler room," you tell the others. "If Mr. Henderson hid the override key there, it’s our only chance to stop this place." The lift opens into a dark, cramped space behind the school’s massive coal furnaces. The air is hot and smells like soot. "Look for the old boiler," Maya says. You find it—a rusted, Victorian-era iron tank that looks like it hasn't been used in fifty years. Inside the pressure gauge, you see a small, silver thumb-drive hidden behind the glass. "That’s it!" Sam reaches for it. But a shadow falls over you. Standing at the entrance to the boiler room is Ms. Grimm. She’s holding a remote control. "Assets 1, 2, and 3," she says coldly. "You are out of your designated zones."
If you dive for the drive before she can stop you, TURN TO PAGE 100.
If you try to reason with her, TURN TO PAGE 101.
Page 92
You drop from the vent, landing squarely on the scientist's shoulders. He lets out a muffled oof as you both tumble to the floor. "Leo! Go!" Sam shouts from above. You scramble to your feet and lung for the Emergency Stop. Your hand slams against the glass cover, shattering it, and you mash the red button. The violet light in Mr. Henderson’s helmet dies instantly. The monitors flatline. Mr. Henderson’s eyes snap open, clear and terrified. "Leo?" he gasps, gasping for air. "What... where am I?" "No time to explain, Mr. H!" you say, fumbling with the buckles on his chair. Maya drops down from the vent next to you, using a pair of wire cutters to snip the remaining straps. Mr. Henderson collapses into your arms, his legs like jelly. "They're coming," Maya warns. TURN TO PAGE 102.
Page 93
"Sam, the wires!" you whisper. Sam reaches into the tangle of cables inside the vent. He finds a thick, glowing fiber-optic line. "This provides the power to the helmet," he says. "If I cut it, the whole system should reboot." He uses the pliers on the multi-tool. SNIP. The room below plunges into darkness. Mr. Henderson screams once, then falls silent. The scientist below starts shouting for a backup generator. "Did we kill him?" Maya asks, her voice trembling. "No," Sam says. "The power is out, but the helmet has a failsafe. We have thirty seconds to get him out before the secondary power kicks in and fries his brain for real." You kick the vent grate open and jump down. You grab Mr. Henderson, who is unconscious but breathing. "We have to carry him," you say. TURN TO PAGE 103.
Page 94
"They were going to freeze him," Maya says, her voice filled with horror. "If we hadn't come down here..." "Look!" Sam points to the end of the hall. A pod is humming loudly, its status light blinking green. It’s not frozen yet. Inside, you see Toby. He’s asleep, his face pressed against the glass. "He’s in the 'Pre-Chamber'!" you shout. "We can still get him out!" You swipe the Golden Keycard across the pod’s control panel. The blue mist begins to drain, and the glass hiss as it slides upward. Toby stumbles forward, shivering violently. "S-S-Sam?" he chivvys. "I dreamt I was an ice cube." "You almost were," you say. Suddenly, the alarm blares. A voice echoes through the speakers: "Unscheduled Thaw in Sector 3. Security teams to the Cooler immediately." TURN TO PAGE 104.
Page 95
"Toby, move!" you scream. You grab Toby’s arm and haul him toward the ventilation shaft. Maya is already halfway up, reaching down to pull you both. The Prefects are closing in, their stun-rods crackling with blue electricity. One of them lunges for your ankle, but Toby kicks him squarely in the chest. "Not today, robot-kid!" Toby yells. You scramble into the vent just as a stun-bolt hits the metal grate, sending sparks flying. You crawl as fast as you can. "Where does this lead?" Sam asks. "It leads to the gym," Maya says. "But there’s a fan at the end. A big, spinning, metal fan." "We’ll have to jam it," you say. "With what?" Sam looks at his backpack. "My gear. All of it." TURN TO PAGE 105.
Page 96
You dive back into the thick, chemical foam, pulling Toby down with you. The white bubbles are nearly waist-high now, smelling like ozone and soap. "Stay low!" you hiss. "They can't see us if we don't move." The Prefects march into the room, their stun-rods humming. They look like robotic statues in the mist. One of them passes so close you can see the AEGIS logo on his belt. He swings his rod blindly through the air, inches above your head. "Scanning..." the Prefect says in a flat, monotone voice. "Visual obscured. Switching to thermal." "Thermal?" Sam whispers. "We’re giant heat signatures! We're cooked!" You look around. There’s a rack of liquid nitrogen canisters. If you crack one open, it might mask your body heat.
If you crack the nitrogen to hide your heat signature, TURN TO PAGE 106.
If you try to bolt for the exit while they’re recalibrating, TURN TO PAGE 107.

"Fine," you say, your voice trembling. "Take the card. Just let him go." You slide the Golden Keycard across the floor. The scientist picks it up, his eyes gleaming with a cruel triumph. He signals to the guards, who release Toby. Toby stumbles toward you, his face pale and eyes unfocused. "Now, let us out," Maya demands. The scientist laughs. "I said I'd let him walk out the door. I never said which door." He presses a button on the card. Suddenly, the floor beneath you tilts. You, Sam, Maya, and Toby slide into a darkened chute. You fall for what feels like miles before landing on a hard, cold surface. A light flickers on. You’re in a holding cell. The walls are smooth, seamless plastic. There are no doors. TURN TO PAGE 108.
Page 98
"Not today!" you yell. You don't wait for him to respond. You lunge forward. At the same time, Maya raises her Polaroid camera. FLASH! The high-intensity bulb explodes in a blinding white light. The scientist screams, clutching his eyes. You tackle him around the waist, knocking the injector out of his hand. It skitters across the floor, the violet liquid spilling into the tiles. "Sam! The keycard!" you shout. Sam grabs the Golden Keycard from the scientist’s pocket. Toby shakes off his daze and kicks the scientist’s chair away. "The back elevator!" Toby yells. "I saw them bring the failed subjects through there!" But as the elevator opens, you see something terrifying. It isn't an empty lift. It's filled with "The Cleaners"—men in hazmat suits carrying flamethrowers.
If you try to fight through the Cleaners, TURN TO PAGE 109.
If you retreat back into the Data Archive, TURN TO PAGE 79.

Mr. Pike’s grip is like iron. He hauls you out of the service lift and tosses you onto a plush carpet. You aren't in a lab anymore. You’re in a room with wood-paneled walls and a massive oak desk. It's the "Principal’s Office." But Oakhaven Elementary doesn't have an office this fancy. A chair swivels around. It’s the Principal, Mr. Hallowell. But he isn't wearing his sweater vest. He’s wearing a tailored black suit with a pin on his lapel—the AEGIS eye. "You’ve been very troublesome, Leo," he says. "Destroying years of neural mapping data? That’s going to come out of your permanent record." "You're the head of this?" you ask. "Experimenting? No," Hallowell says. "I’m optimizing them." He nods to Pike. "Take them to the 'Brain-Drain.'" TURN TO PAGE 110.

You don't think. You dive. Your fingers graze the cold glass of the pressure gauge. You smash it with the butt of your multi-tool and grab the silver thumb-drive just as a red laser dot settles on your chest. "Freeze!" Ms. Grimm barks. The boiler room door slams shut, and you hear the heavy clunk of an electronic deadbolt. You’re trapped in the heat, the massive furnace groaning like a living thing. "She’s locking us in to bake!" Sam yells. "No," Maya says, looking at the drive in your hand. "She’s locking us in because she’s afraid of what’s on this. Look—there’s a computer terminal hidden behind the coal pile." You plug the drive in. The screen flickers to life, showing a live feed of the school’s gym. The floor is opening up, revealing a massive satellite array.

"Ms. Grimm, wait!" you shout, holding up your hands. "Mr. Henderson told us everything! He was your friend! You don't have to do this!" Ms. Grimm pauses, her finger hovering over the remote. For a second, her cold expression softens. "Arthur was a dreamer," she says quietly. "He didn't understand that progress requires... sacrifice." "Sacrificing kids isn't progress!" Maya yells. "It is for the future of the human race," Grimm says, her face hardening. She presses a button. A high-pitched frequency fills the room. Your ears ring. Sam collapses to his knees. Obey. Sit. Listen. The words aren't coming from the air; they're coming from inside your head.

Mr. Henderson leans on you and Maya, his breathing ragged. "The hallway... is a death trap," he wheezes. "But Henderson... always has... a Plan B." He points to a floor tile near the corner. "The drainage... for the chemical vats. It leads... to the old sewer lines." You and Maya slide the heavy metal cover aside. A foul, damp smell wafts up, but it’s the smell of freedom. You help Mr. Henderson down into the dark tunnel. "Sam, you coming?" you call up. "Just a second!" Sam is frantically typing at the scientist’s computer. "I’m setting the lab's cooling system to 'Maximum Overdrive.' In ten minutes, this whole level turns into a popsicle." TURN TO PAGE 114.
Page 103
"He’s too heavy!" Maya pants as you drag Mr. Henderson’s limp body toward the emergency exit. "We have to use the cart!" you shout, pointing to a flatbed trolley. You hoist the unconscious teacher onto the metal cart. Sam jumps on the back, using a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster. He thumps the valve, and the blast of white spray sends the cart hurtling down the hallway. You steer the cart around a sharp corner, narrowly missing a patrol of Prefects. You reach the service elevator, but the door is locked. "Thirty seconds until the power comes back!" Sam warns.

"The loading dock is right through those doors," Toby says, his teeth still chattering. "But look at the floor. Those red lines? They’re motion-sensing lasers. If we break one, the whole room goes into lockdown." You look at the grid. It’s a dizzying web of red light. "I can do this," Toby says. "You just have to follow the rhythm of the pulses." Toby begins to move, twisting his body through gaps in the light. He reaches the halfway point and beckons you forward. Suddenly, a loud MEOW echoes through the dock. Sitting on a crate of 'Neural Serum' is Shadow, Toby’s cat. He’s swishing his tail right next to a master laser.

"The fan is coming up!" Sam yells. The roar of the giant metal blades is deafening. You can feel the suction pulling you toward the spinning death trap at the end of the vent. "Sam, now!" you scream. Sam hurls his backpack into the blades. His walkie-talkies, batteries, and digital camera fly into the machinery. CRA-CRACK-SHING! The fan lets out a mechanical scream. The blades shudder and stop with a violent jolt. You kick the jammed blades out of the way and tumble out into the school gym. It’s dark, but the floor is vibrating. The giant Oakhaven logo in the center of the gym is sliding open, revealing a glowing, silver sphere. TURN TO PAGE 119.

"Do it!" you whisper. You and Sam grip the heavy valve of the liquid nitrogen tank. With a coordinated heave, you twist it. HSSSSS! A cloud of super-chilled vapor erupts, clumping with the fire foam. The temperature drops forty degrees in seconds. Through the fog, you see the Prefects stop. Their red-lensed visors sweep the area. "Heat signatures lost," a monotone voice reports. The Prefects turn and march back toward the main lab. You wait until their footsteps fade. "Look," Maya says, pointing to a small control box. "That controls the neural-link. If we pull those cables, every mind-controlled kid will wake up." TURN TO PAGE 120.
Page 107
"The nitrogen is too risky," you decide. "We have to bolt while they're scanning the other side. Go!" You burst from the foam, Toby and Sam right behind you. Your sneakers slap against the tile—a sound that echoes like a gunshot. "Detection!" the Prefects shout. You dive toward the automatic doors, but they don't slide open. "Lockdown initiated," the computer voice booms. You’re trapped. Sam frantically pulls out a high-powered magnet. "If I can scramble the door’s internal relay, we might get through! But you have to hold them off!"

The holding cell is a nightmare of white plastic and humming silence. "They're going to keep us here until the serum is ready," Toby says, looking defeated. "Not if I can help it," Maya says. She examines the light fixture. "Sam, give me your glasses. The lenses are high-index glass. If I can focus the LED light, I might melt a hole." It's a long shot. But as Maya holds the glasses up, a tiny, intense bead of light appears. A smell of burning plastic fills the room. Suddenly, the wall vibrates. "Asset interaction detected. Initiating sedative gas."

The "Cleaners" don't hesitate. One pulls the trigger on his flamethrower, and a tongue of fire licks the air, scorching the Data Archive doors. "Get back!" you yell. The heat is intense. "Sam, the fire extinguisher!" you shout. Sam grabs the canister. "It won't stop a flamethrower, Leo!" "Don't spray the fire!" you say. "Spray the ceiling! The heat-sensitive sprinklers!" Sam aims upward and blasts the sensors. A second later, the ceiling erupts. But it isn't water—it’s a thick, purple flame-retardant gel that coats everything, including the Cleaners' nozzles. "Now! To the stairs!" TURN TO PAGE 125.

The "Brain-Drain" is a room filled with what look like oversized hair dryers connected to vats of violet liquid. "The human brain is inefficient," Principal Hallowell says as Mr. Pike straps you into a chair. "With the AEGIS hive-mind, every student will be part of a single processor. No more bullying. No more failing grades. Just... order." "You're erasing who we are!" you shout. "I’m erasing the 'noise,'" Hallowell corrects. The 'dryer' lowers over your head. You feel a tingly sensation. Your memories of Sam, Maya, and Toby begin to feel fuzzy.

The computer screen shows a map of the world. Thousands of tiny red dots are appearing. "This is the 'Aethelgard Network,'" Maya says. "They’re using students' brainpower to crack encryption codes for every bank in the world. They're making a global heist machine." You look at the thumb-drive. "There has to be a kill-switch." You find a file titled: CUCKOO_EGG.EXE. "A virus!" Sam says. "If we upload this, it will fry the AEGIS servers." "But the upload takes five minutes," Maya warns. "And Ms. Grimm is currently axing through the door."
If you stay to finish the upload, TURN TO PAGE 128.
If you grab the drive and run for the roof to get a better signal, TURN TO PAGE 129.

The frequency is a physical weight. Obey. Sit. Listen. "No!" you roar. You think of Toby’s orange beanie. You think of the way Maya rolls her eyes. These aren't just 'assets.' These are your people. Your anger creates a shield. The frequency is still there, but it’s just noise now. You look at Sam and Maya—they’re still struggling. "The remote!" you yell. "Maya, the remote in her hand!" Maya looks up, her face pale. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out her Polaroid camera. She doesn't take a photo. She throws the heavy camera with all her might. TURN TO PAGE 130.
Page 113
You let your arms go limp. You let your jaw hang open. You stare at the wall with blank eyes. "That’s it," you hear Ms. Grimm purr. "Good assets. Walk toward me." You shuffle forward, mimicking the robotic gait of the Prefects. Sam and Maya follow your lead. You can see the smug certainty on Ms. Grimm’s face—she didn't expect the signal to work this fast. She lowers the remote, her thumb slipping off the trigger button. You’re only three feet away now. You can see the light on the remote turning from red to green. "Now!" you scream. TURN TO PAGE 131.

You drop into the sewer line just as the lab’s emergency coolant hits 100%. Above you, the sound of the lab changes from a hum to a violent CRACK. Through the drainage cover, you see the air turn into a white wall of frost. The guards are instantly frozen in place. You and Maya carry Mr. Henderson through the darkness. The sewer is narrow, but after ten minutes, you find a ladder. You push a grate open. You’re in the middle of the school’s soccer field. The moon is out. "They're still in there," Mr. Henderson wheezes. "We have to get the word out."

"Hotwire it!" you yell. You rip the plastic cover off the elevator panel. "Sam, which wires?" "The green and the red! AEGIS uses non-standard coding!" You grab the wires and touch them together. SPARK! A jolt of electricity shoots up your arm, making your teeth ache. But the elevator doors groan and slide open. "Get him in!" You and Maya heave the cart onto the lift. The doors shut just as the power returns. You hear the guards shouting. "Going up," the elevator says. The display shows you’re heading for the ROOF. "Why the roof?" Maya asks. "Because that's where the transmission dish is," you realize. TURN TO PAGE 134.
Page 116
"No time for wiring!" you yell. You grab the heavy fire extinguisher and swing it like a sledgehammer. CRUNCH! The elevator car shudders, then with a loud ping, the doors slide open. "We’re on the roof," Maya whispers. A massive satellite dish is humming in the center. Mr. Henderson, still unconscious, begins to glow with a pulsing violet light. "He’s an antenna!" Sam says. "They’re broadcasting the command signal to the whole town!" Across the roof, a door slams open. It’s the Principal, holding a flare gun. "Step away from the asset, Leo."

"Shadow, stay!" Toby whispers. He lunges across the red light, catching the cat mid-leap just before his paw breaks the laser. Toby rolls into a ball, holding Shadow tight, and slides across the floor. He stops inches away from the exit. "Got him," Toby pants. You reach the loading dock door. You swipe the Golden Keycard. The door unseals with a hiss. You step out into the school’s parking lot. Every window in the building is glowing with a pulsing violet light. "They’ve started the broadcast," Maya says. "We have to stop the generator."
If you go back in to find the generator, TURN TO PAGE 137 (Correction: 134/Conclusion).
If you run to the police station for help, TURN TO PAGE 133.
Page 118
"Forget the cat, Toby! We have to move!" you yell. You dive for the door, but it’s too late. Shadow’s tail flicks through a beam. A high-pitched alarm wails. Heavy steel shutters slam down, sealing you inside. The floor begins to slide away, revealing a pit filled with a thick, violet gas. "The neuro-mist!" Sam yells. "If we breathe that in, we're finished!" You look up. There’s a crane hook hanging from the ceiling. If you can climb it, you might be able to reach the ventilation shafts. TURN TO PAGE 138 (Correction: 134/Conclusion).

The silver sphere in the center of the gym pulses with light. Cables snake into the floorboards, connecting to the lab below. "That’s the Hub," Toby says. "It’s collecting the thoughts of everyone in the school." Suddenly, the gym doors lock. The scoreboard flickers to life: 05:00... 04:59... "Phase Three," a voice booms. It’s Principal Hallowell. "Your brainwaves will be the final piece of the network." The sphere begins to spin, creating a vacuum that pulls you toward it. "We need to jam the Hub!" Maya yells. TURN TO PAGE 125.
Page 120
"Do it, Maya!" you say. Maya grabs the bundle of fiber-optic cables and tears them from the control box. SPARK! A shower of blue electricity hits the floor. Instantly, the students in the cubicles jerk awake. The violet light in their headbands fades. "Where am I?" one boy shouts. "Chaos," Sam grins. "The best kind of distraction." The scientists are overwhelmed by confused students. This is your chance to reach the central elevator. But as you run, you see Mr. Pike blocking the way. He’s angry. TURN TO PAGE 99.
Page 121
"Shields up!" you yell. You and Toby grab a heavy surgical cart and flip it. You huddle behind it as the Prefects fire their stun-rods. ZZZZT! The bolts bounce off the metal. "I’m almost through!" Sam screams, working on the door relay. The Prefects reach the cart and try to shove it aside. "Now!" Sam yells. The doors slide open just enough to squeeze through. You scramble through the gap, but as Maya follows, a Prefect grabs her backpack. "Go!" Maya yells. "I'll hold them off!"
If you stop to save Maya, TURN TO PAGE 122.
If you follow her lead and keep going to find the core, TURN TO PAGE 134.

"No one gets left behind!" you roar. You grab a heavy tray of surgical tools and hurl it. CLATTER! The Prefect flinches, and Maya rips her arm free. "Wait," Toby says, looking at the Prefect's face. "That’s Kyle. He was on my soccer team." Toby steps forward. "Kyle! Remember the championship game? You scored the winning goal in the rain!" The Prefect freezes. The cold light in his eyes flickers. "Rain..." he whispers. "Kyle, help us!" you say. Kyle points a trembling finger toward a red door. "Stop... the pulse..." TURN TO PAGE 134.
Page 123
"Hold your breath!" you command. Maya presses her glasses against the plastic wall. The plastic begins to bubble under the intense heat of the focused light. Your lungs burn. Sam is turning blue. POP. A small hole appears. Maya kicks it, and a large chunk of the softened plastic gives way. You tumble out into a dark service corridor just as the gas fills the cell behind you. "We... made it," Sam wheezes. You find yourself in the "Venting Room"—massive pipes that carry neuro-mist. If you sabotage the main pump, you can stop the gas. TURN TO PAGE 131.
Page 124
"Block the vents!" you shout. You and Toby rip off your hoodies and stuff them into the ceiling grates. The fabric begins to bulge as the green mist seeps through. "We’re just buying time," Maya says. Sam pulls a small magnet from his pocket and starts dragging it along the wall, looking for the magnetic latch. CLICK. A hidden panel opens. "I can short the lock!" Sam says. "But it will trigger an alarm." "Do it," you say. "Better the guards than the gas." TURN TO PAGE 125.
Page 125
You reach for the red handle of the fire alarm. "If we can't stop them with logic, we’ll stop them with water!" You pull the lever. ERRRR-ERRRR-ERRRR! The ceiling sprinklers erupt. But it’s not just water. Because of the lab chemicals, the water reacts with the air, creating a thick purple gel. "The gel!" Sam shouts. "It’s conductive! It’s shorting out their headbands!" The guards begin to shake as their gear malfunctions. "To the service stairs!" you yell. You burst through a door into the school hallway. TURN TO PAGE 134.
Page 126
"You want my brain? Fine! Take this!" You open the floodgates to your most cringeworthy memory: the time you accidentally called Ms. Grimm "Mom" while wearing mismatched shoes and tripping over a trash can. The machine groans. AEGIS is built on logic and perfection; it can’t handle the messy "noise" of human embarrassment. SPARK! The "Brain-Drain" dryer erupts in orange sparks. "System error!" the computer screams. The straps on your chair click open. You tumble to the floor. You’re still you. TURN TO PAGE 134.
Page 127
You focus on the math paradox Toby showed you: If a set contains all sets that do not contain themselves, does it contain itself? You repeat the logic over and over. The AEGIS processor tries to calculate the answer, its cooling fans screaming. "Warning," the computer voice stutters. "Core temperature rising." Principal Hallowell bangs on his desk. "No! Recalibrate!" But it’s too late. The purple light in the vats turns a bright red. With a loud POP, the glass tubes shatter. "My work!" Hallowell wails. TURN TO PAGE 134.
Page 128
"Stay back, Ms. Grimm!" you yell. UPLOAD: 90%... The door gives way. Ms. Grimm steps through the splinters. She raises a stun-baton. "Give me the drive, Leo." "I understand it’s a theft machine!" you retort. 98%... 100%. UPLOAD COMPLETE. CUCKOO_EGG.EXE EXECUTING. Suddenly, every headband in the lab flashes with a pixelated image of a chicken. The high-pitched frequency stops, replaced by a loud, rhythmic clucking sound. "The virus!" Sam cheers. TURN TO PAGE 135.

"We need a better signal! To the roof!" You grab the drive and sprint out, Sam and Maya behind you. You scramble up the fire escape and plug the drive into the satellite maintenance port. "Upload initiated!" Maya shouts. Three AEGIS drones rise from the roof, their red eyes fixed on you. Sam uses his heavy flashlight to swat at them while Maya uses her camera flash to blind their sensors. DING. Upload Successful. The drones instantly lose power, falling out of the sky. Below, the violet glow in the windows fades. TURN TO PAGE 135.

THWACK! The heavy Polaroid camera strikes Ms. Grimm square in the forehead. She stumbles back, the remote slipping from her fingers. "Grab it!" you yell. Sam dives for the remote and catches it just before it hits the ground. He frantically smashes the big blue "CANCEL" button. The ringing in your ears stops. The crushing weight on your mind lifts. "We... we did it?" Sam asks. "Not yet," Maya says. "Look—the students! They’re waking up!" Confused students are pouring into the hallways, sweeping away the guards. TURN TO PAGE 134.
Page 131
"NOW!" You spring forward and tackle Ms. Grimm's knees while Sam and Maya grab her arms. She shrieks in surprise, the remote skittering across the floor. "You brats! You're destroying the future!" "The future doesn't belong to you!" you yell. Maya grabs the remote and throws it into the red-hot opening of the coal furnace. BOOM! The remote explodes in a flare of green sparks. The vibration in the walls stops. Ms. Grimm slumps against the wall, defeated. "The Hub... it’s gone." TURN TO PAGE 134.

"We have to go public," you say. You, Sam, Maya, and a hobbling Mr. Henderson race to the local news station, Oakhaven 5. You burst into the lobby, covered in soot and purple gel. Ten minutes later, you’re on a live broadcast. Mr. Henderson shows his scars and the AEGIS blueprints. By sunrise, Oakhaven Elementary is surrounded by news vans and the FBI. Principal Hallowell is led out in handcuffs, still insisting he was just "improving the curve." TURN TO PAGE 135.
Page 133
"The police," you say. "Officer Miller will believe us." You sprint to the station. When Miller sees the four of you—and the terrified look on Mr. Henderson’s face—he listens. "A lab under the gym?" Within twenty minutes, a SWAT team is breaching the maintenance doors. You watch from the back of an ambulance as they haul out crates of violet serum. Toby finds you and gives you a high-five. "I hope they cast someone cool to play me in the movie." TURN TO PAGE 135.
Page 134
The facility is in total collapse. Without the Hub, the AEGIS lab is just a series of dark rooms. You find Mr. Henderson and Toby near the exit. Henderson gives a weak smile. "I knew the Detective Club wouldn't miss a deadline." You lead the group into the school's main lobby. The morning sun is peeking through the glass doors. Behind you, the elevator is remotely disabled. The lab is sealed. The secret is out. "What happens now?" Sam asks. "Now," Maya says, "we go get some breakfast." TURN TO PAGE 135.
Page 135
THE END: THE SHADOW ORGANIZATION. Oakhaven Elementary is closed for a national investigation. Principal Hallowell and the AEGIS board are headed for trial. Mr. Henderson returns to teaching. Toby is a local hero. You, Sam, and Maya make a pact: no more basements. "So," Sam asks as you watch the sunset. "What are we doing this weekend?" "I heard there’s a strange light from the lighthouse," Toby says. "Toby," you say firmly. "Shut up." Everyone laughs. The world is safe. For now.

The air changes the second you step over the rusted fence into the Forbidden Woods. Behind you, the sounds of school—the yelling, the hum of air conditioners—vanish. It’s as if someone pressed a "mute" button on the world. "I don't like this," Sam whispers. He reaches for his walkie-talkie, but it emits a low, melodic chime. Shadow, Toby’s cat, sits on a mossy log. His green eyes glow with an intensity that seems too bright for the shade. He lets out a sharp meow and leaps into a thicket. TURN TO PAGE 137.
Page 137
The deeper you go, the stranger the light becomes. The sun is high, but the shadows on the ground are pointing in three different directions. "Wait," Sam says. He points to an oak tree with a carving: T + L + S + M. "That’s our tree," you say. "The one we carved in third grade. But that was on the other side of the woods." "We’ve only been walking five minutes," Maya says. "But my watch says it’s 4:15 PM." You look back. The school is gone. In its place is a wall of grey mist like television static.
If you try to walk back into the mist to find the school, TURN TO PAGE 138.
If you keep following Shadow deeper into the woods, TURN TO PAGE 139.
Page 138
"We have to go back," you say. You turn and walk toward the grey mist. You step into the grey, but the air feels like dry paper. Your skin prickles with static. You walk for a hundred steps, then trip. You look down. It’s a school desk. Toby’s desk, with the dinosaur sticker. It sits perfectly upright in the middle of the grey void. On the desk is a math test Toby took last week. But the red ink from the grading is moving. The "B-" is crawling across the page like a beetle. TURN TO PAGE 140.
Page 139
"We have to find Toby," you say. Shadow leads you to a clearing where trees grow in a perfect circle. In the center is a red telephone booth, covered in vines. The receiver is hanging by its cord. The sound coming from it isn't a dial tone; it’s a voice. “...help... lost the Tuesday... Toby, stay behind the glass...” "That’s Mr. Henderson!" Maya cries. She grabs the receiver. The voice on the other end stops. Then, a new sound: Click. Click. Click-clack. Ms. Grimm’s heels on a hardwood floor, echoing out of the phone.
If you listen to the phone to hear more, TURN TO PAGE 141.
If you hang up the phone and look for Toby in the clearing, TURN TO PAGE 142.

The grey void begins to shimmer. Slowly, the mist thins, but you aren't back at the school. You’re in a hallway that looks like Oakhaven, but everything is wrong. The lockers are ten feet tall. The floor is made of grass. Clocks on the walls are running backward. "Look at the trophy case," Sam says. Inside, there are jars filled with memories. SAM’S 9TH BIRTHDAY. LEO’S FIRST BIKE RIDE. At the end is a dark, empty jar. The label reads: TOBY MILLER. STATUS: ERASED. "He’s being unwritten," Maya says. TURN TO PAGE 143.
Page 141
You press the receiver to your ear. "The project is not a thing... it is a loop," Henderson’s voice says. "Tuesday is repeating, but it’s folding in on itself. If you see the cat, do not trust it. Find the classroom with no windows." The line goes dead. But the "click-clack" of heels is getting louder, and it's coming from the woods. A figure steps out of the shadows. It looks like Ms. Grimm, but her face is a blur of static. She’s holding a giant pair of silver scissors. "Assets must be trimmed."
If you run toward the Creek of Echoes, TURN TO PAGE 144.
If you hide inside the telephone booth, TURN TO PAGE 145.

"It’s a trap," you say. Shadow the cat sits on top of the phone booth, watching you. The air begins to ripple. A shape forms: it’s Toby. He’s sitting at a cafeteria table, eating a sandwich. But he looks like a ghost—you can see the trees through his chest. "Toby!" you yell. Your hand passes right through his shoulder. He doesn't look up. "He’s stuck in a 'Ghost Tuesday,'" Maya says. "He’s reliving a single minute of yesterday. We have to 'sync' our reality with his." TURN TO PAGE 146.
Page 143
"We can't forget him!" you shout. You raise your fist to smash the trophy case, but the glass isn't solid. It feels like cold honey. Your hand sinks into it. "Maya, help me!" As you drag your hand out, you aren't holding a jar. You’re holding a memory: a small wooden toy knight Toby used to carry. The moment you touch it, the hallway flickers. For a second, you see Toby at the end of the hall, pointing at a door labeled ROOM 4B - ARCHIVE. Then the floor begins to dissolve into black ink. TURN TO PAGE 147.

You bolt toward the sound of rushing water. The Creek of Echoes is silver, and it’s flowing upwards defying gravity. "The echoes!" Sam yells. In the ripples, you see faces. Yourself as a five-year-old. Mr. Henderson wearing a crown of chalk. "It’s every version of us that ever existed," Maya whispers. "If we jump in, we can travel back to Monday!" Across the creek, the static-Ms. Grimm is standing on the water, her silver scissors snipping at the reflections of your lives.

"Into the booth! Now!" The three of you pile into the tiny red box. Outside, the static-Ms. Grimm begins to snip the air around the booth. With every snip, a piece of the woods disappears, replaced by a white void. "She’s cutting us out of the map!" Sam screams. You look at the rotary dial. There are symbols: a sun, a moon, a clock, and a question mark. "We have to dial a destination!"
If you dial the "Clock" symbol, TURN TO PAGE 150.
If you dial the "Question Mark" symbol, TURN TO PAGE 151 (Correction: 151/Next set).

"The cat is the anchor," you say. Maya steps forward, holding out a piece of Toby's favorite pizza. The smell wafts through the clearing, and the ghostly Toby stops chewing. He looks up. Shadow pounces onto the ghostly cafeteria table. As his paws touch the surface, a shockwave of violet light ripples outward. The clearing vanishes. You are standing in the school cafeteria, but it’s empty. The walls are featureless white. Toby is sitting there, staring at a giant grandfather clock that has no hands. TURN TO PAGE 152 (Correction: 152/Next set).

The floor turns into black, swirling ink. "Don't sink!" you yell. You scramble onto a floating bookshelf. The books here have names: THE LIFE OF ARTHUR HENDERSON. THE ADVENTURES OF MAYA CHEN. Maya pulls a book: THE END OF THE DETECTIVE CLUB. "Don't open it!" Sam screams. "If you read the ending, it might come true!" At the far end of the room is a golden door labeled THE AUTHOR’S OFFICE. Between you and the door, a giant ink-covered hand rises, holding a fountain pen like a spear.

"I’m not letting go!" you roar. You take a deep breath and leap into the silver, upward-flowing water. The sensation is like falling upward through a thousand memories. You grab a "Toby" from the stream. He feels warm and real. But the water pulls at your memories. You forget the name of your first dog. You forget your own middle name. "Leo! Let go!" Maya screams. "If you stay in there any longer, you’ll become part of the creek!"

"The bridge," you say, pointing to a shimmering arch of light. "It’s made of Frozen Time." You step onto the bridge. You see a bird frozen mid-flight. As you walk, the bridge begins to crack. The static-Ms. Grimm is at the other end. She isn't walking; she’s erasing. Every step she takes makes a piece of the bridge vanish into a white void. "You are a paradox," she says. "Paradoxes must be deleted."

You spin the rotary dial to the CLOCK symbol. The phone booth begins to shake. Outside, the woods blur into a streak of green. DING. The door pops open. You are in Room 4B, but it’s Monday—the day before Toby disappeared. Toby is at his desk, laughing. Mr. Henderson is at the board. "We went back in time!" Sam whispers. But then you notice the faces of your classmates. They don't have eyes. Where their eyes should be, there are small, ticking clock-faces. "Welcome back," the clock-eye Toby says.

You spin the dial to the QUESTION MARK. The phone booth doesn't move. Instead, the walls of the booth fall away like wet cardboard. You are standing on a giant, floating chessboard in the middle of a star-filled nebula. Across from you, sitting on a throne made of lost socks and broken pencils, is a creature that looks like a giant owl wearing Mr. Henderson’s bowtie. "Ah," the Owl-Teacher says, ruffling its feathers. "The detectives have arrived. You’re looking for the Lost Boy, aren't you?" "Toby," you say, trying to keep your voice steady. "Give him back." "I don't 'give' anything," the Owl says, pulling a deck of cards from its wing. "Everything in the 'Thin Place' is a trade. Play a game of 'Logic or Luck.' If you win, the boy is yours. If you lose, you become the new Librarian."

"The Librarian?" Maya asks, looking at the featureless white walls. Suddenly, a door appears. A tall, spindly woman with skin the color of old parchment walks in. She’s carrying a massive ledger. She looks at Toby, then at you. "Toby Miller is a 'Draft Version,'" she says. "He was never meant to be in the Final Publication of Reality. He has too many 'quirks.' He’s being replaced by a more... streamlined character." She points to the chair next to Toby. A boy who looks exactly like Toby, but with perfectly combed hair and a boring expression, begins to materialize. "No!" you yell. "Toby is our friend because he’s quirky! You can't replace him!" "The Editor has spoken," the Librarian says. "Unless you can prove he is 'Essential to the Plot.'"

"Run for the door!" you yell. You leap from the floating bookshelf, diving through the air as the giant fountain pen slams into the wood behind you, spraying black ink everywhere. You scramble across the shifting floor, which feels like walking on a giant, wet tongue. You reach the golden door. Sam and Maya are right behind you. You grab the handle, but it’s locked. "The key!" Sam yells. "Look at the pen!" The ink-covered hand is preparing for another strike. You notice that the "nib" of the pen is shaped like a key. To unlock the door, you have to let the Author's hand "write" on the door itself. Maya pushes you aside just as the pen-spear lunges forward.
If you let the pen strike the door to unlock it, TURN TO PAGE 164.
If you try to break the pen, TURN TO PAGE 165.

"I'm opening the book!" Maya says. She flips to the final chapter of THE END OF THE DETECTIVE CLUB. The pages are blank, except for a single sentence at the bottom: To change the end, the characters must refuse to play their roles. "What does that mean?" Sam asks. "It means I'm not the 'Anxious Logic Nerd' anymore!" Sam yells at the ceiling. He grabs his high-range walkie-talkie and throws it into the ink. "And Leo isn't the 'Brave Leader'!" "I'm scared!" you shout, leaning into the truth. "I have no idea what I'm doing!" As soon as you say the words, the ink floor stops rising. It begins to drain away, revealing the real school hallway underneath. TURN TO PAGE 166.
Page 155
"I’m not letting go!" you roar. You wrap your arms around the Toby from the stream. The silver water surges over your head. You feel your memory of the color blue vanish. You forget the taste of chocolate. You forget your own middle name. But you don't forget Toby. You hold on to that one single fact: Toby is my friend. With a final, desperate heave, you kick off the bottom of the silver creek. You burst through the surface and roll onto the mossy bank, dragging Toby with you. He coughs up a spray of silver liquid. His eyes clear. "Leo? Why are we in the woods?" You look at your hands. They’re slightly translucent, like a faded photograph. You saved him, but a piece of you stayed in the water.
TURN TO PAGE 167 FOR THE "FADED HEROES" ENDING.
Page 156
The current is too strong, and the "memory-drain" is too painful. With a cry of agony, your fingers slip. The silver version of Toby is swept away, his hand reaching out one last time before he dissolves into a stream of shimmering bubbles. "Toby!" you scream, but your voice sounds like a recording being played backward. You drag yourself onto the mossy bank, gasping for air. Maya and Sam pull you up, but their faces are blurred, their features shifting like watercolor in the rain. "He's gone," Sam whispers. "And I... I can't remember what color his beanie was." You look up at the sky. It isn't blue anymore. It’s a dull, static grey. By letting go of Toby, you let go of the anchor that kept this reality colorful.
TURN TO PAGE 168 FOR THE "GREY WORLD" ENDING.
Page 157
"Run!" you yell, grabbing Sam and Maya’s hands. You sprint across the bridge of "Frozen Time." Beneath your feet, you feel the vibrations of ancient birthdays and future snow days. Behind you, static-Ms. Grimm is moving with terrifying speed, her giant scissors snip-snapping the bridge into nothingness. A piece of the bridge vanishes right under Sam’s foot. He lunges forward, barely catching the edge of a "Memory of a Summer Picnic." You reach the end of the arch just as the final piece of the bridge dissolves. You tumble onto a platform of solid white light. You look back. Ms. Grimm is standing at the edge of the void, her static-face flickering. Standing on the platform is a version of Mr. Henderson made of glass. TURN TO PAGE 169.
Page 158
"The bridge is made of moments!" you realize. "If she’s using the 'Future' to erase us, we’ll use the 'Past' to stop her!" You kneel down and reach into the shimmering surface of the bridge. You pull out a "Moment"—it’s the memory of the loudest lightning strike you ever heard during a third-grade thunderstorm. It feels like a jagged, humming crystal in your hand. "Eat this!" you yell, hurling the memory at the static-Ms. Grimm. The "Moment" explodes on impact. A deafening BOOM of thunder echoes through the rift. Ms. Grimm shatters into a thousand black pixels that drift away like soot. The bridge stops breaking. The arch of light now leads directly into a giant, hovering version of your school’s clock tower. TURN TO PAGE 170.
Page 159
The Toby-with-clock-eyes stands up. The tick-tock sound coming from his face is deafening. "The Project is simple, Leo," he says. "To keep Monday running, we need a battery. Toby Miller was chosen. His quirkiness provides enough energy to power the loop for a hundred years." "You're using our friend as a battery?" Maya yells. The clock-eye students begin to march toward you, their movements jerky. "Join the loop. No Tuesday. Just the clicking." You look at the back of the room. The "Real" Toby is there, strapped to the wall behind the chalkboard. A thick copper wire runs from his chest to the school’s main clock.
If you try to cut the wire to free Toby, TURN TO PAGE 171.
If you try to smash the main clock, TURN TO PAGE 172.
Page 160
"I choose Logic," you say, stepping onto a square of the giant chessboard. The Owl-Teacher hoots. "Very well. Here is the riddle of the Rift: A boy enters the woods at 10:00 AM. He stays for an hour, but when he leaves, it is 10:00 AM again. Did the boy travel in time, or did the time travel through the boy?" Sam whispers, "It’s a trick question!" "No," Maya says. "Time is a liquid." You look at the Owl. "Neither," you say firmly. "The boy didn't move, and time didn't move. The story moved. We’re in a draft of a book that was never finished." The Owl’s eyes widen. The chessboard begins to fold up like a piece of paper. TURN TO PAGE 173.
Page 161
"I’ll take my chances with Luck," you say. The Owl-Teacher fans out a deck of glowing cards. "Pick one. If it’s the 'Sun,' you go free. If it’s the 'Void,' you stay here as a gargoyle on the school roof." You reach out. You feel a strange warmth coming from one of the cards. It feels like Toby’s laughter. You grab it and flip it over. It isn't a Sun. It isn't the Void. It’s a drawing of a black cat with a white ear. "The Cat?" the Owl says. "That’s the 'Wildcard.' It means the rules no longer apply to you." The nebula around you begins to swirl. You, Sam, and Maya are sucked into a vortex of color. TURN TO PAGE 174.
Page 162
"He’s essential!" you yell at the Librarian. "Look at this!" You grab Sam and Maya’s hands. You focus all your energy on the memory of the time Toby stayed up all night helping you build your volcano model, even though he was allergic to the paper-mache. A projection of the memory appears. The Librarian watches as the ghostly Toby laughs and sneezes. "See?" Maya says. "Without him, the 'Detective Club' doesn't work. The story ends on page 10." The Librarian tilts her head. A single tear, made of black ink, rolls down her cheek. "Emotion... it is an inefficient narrative device. But... it is compelling." She snaps her fingers. The boring Toby vanishes. TURN TO PAGE 175.
Page 163
"Maya, distract her!" you whisper. Maya steps forward. "Wait! You missed a typo on page 42!" The Librarian gasps. "A typo? Impossible!" While she’s frantically flipping through the pages, you and Sam lunge for the stamp on the table. You grab it—it feels heavy and cold. You jump onto the table and slam the stamp onto Toby’s ghostly chest. REJECTED, the stamp says in bright red ink. The Librarian screams as a surge of red energy blasts through the room. "You’ve ruined the edit!" The white walls of the cafeteria begin to peel away. Toby is solid again, but the Librarian is turning into a swarm of paper moths. TURN TO PAGE 176.
Page 164
"Let the pen write!" you command. You pull Maya and Sam back. The giant ink-hand lunges. The nib of the pen strikes the golden door with a sound like a gong. Instead of a hole, the pen leaves a swirling, glowing word written in a language you can’t read, but you understand it. It means: OPEN. The golden door creaks open. A blinding white light pours out. Inside, there is just a small wooden desk and a typewriter that is typing by itself. “The three friends entered the room,” the typewriter clacks. “Leo looked at the page and said...” You walk up to the typewriter.
If you type "We are going home now," TURN TO PAGE 177.
If you type "Toby is standing right behind us," TURN TO PAGE 178.
Page 165
"Break the pen!" you yell. "If he can't write, he can't erase us!" You and Sam grab a heavy, floating dictionary and swing it like a battering ram. CRACK! The giant fountain pen snaps in half. Black ink explodes across the room. The giant hand withers and disappears. But without the pen, the room starts to lose its detail. The golden door turns into a flat, grey rectangle. The bookshelves become blurry smudges. "The world is un-painting!" Maya yells. You look down at your own hands. Your fingers are turning into simple pencil sketches. "Does anyone have a crayon? A marker? Anything?!"
If you use a crayon to draw a new door, TURN TO PAGE 179.
If you try to use the spilled ink to 'paint' Toby back, TURN TO PAGE 180.
Page 166
The ink-drenched golden door swings open. You are standing on the edge of a giant, floating sheet of lined paper. The sky is a vast, starry expanse of blue ink. Toby stands in the center. He isn't a ghost anymore, but he’s covered in red "Delete" marks. "I can't feel my feet," Toby says. "The story is trying to end without me." You look around. There is a giant, floating eraser hovering near the edge of the page, moving toward Toby. Behind it is the Librarian, her moth-wing cape fluttering. "The narrative must be clean!" she shrieks. "One friend must be deleted so the others can grow!"
If you try to draw a shield around Toby with the ink, TURN TO PAGE 181.
If you try to tackle the Eraser, TURN TO PAGE 182.
Page 167
You and Toby sit on the bank of the silver creek. The "Glitch" has passed, and Oakhaven Elementary is visible again. "We did it," Toby says. But when he tries to high-five you, your hands pass through each other with a soft, static hum. You saved Toby, but the cost was high. You traded half of your own existence. You walk back to school, but nobody notices you. Ms. Grimm looks right through you. Your parents think you've been missing for a week, even when you're standing right in front of them. You are the "Faded." You live in the shadows of the school, solving mysteries that normal people can't see. You’re heroes, but you’re ghosts.
THE END: FADED HEROES.
Page 168
You wake up in your bed. It’s Tuesday morning. You go to school, and Toby is there. He’s sitting at his desk, wearing his orange beanie. Everything seems perfect. Except... the color is gone. The sky is grey. The grass is grey. Your favorite red hoodie is grey. When you talk to Toby, he doesn't tell jokes anymore. He just recites facts from the textbook. Maya doesn't take photos. Sam doesn't build gadgets. By letting go of Toby in the silver creek, you saved his body but lost the "Spark." The world is safe, but it’s boring. You spend the rest of your life wondering why you feel like you forgot the most important thing in the universe.
THE END: GREY WORLD.
Page 169
The Glass Henderson stands in the center of the white light. "Children," he says. "You have reached the White Room—the place where the story is planned. I am the Guardian of the Outline." "Give us Toby back," you say. "Toby Miller was a mistake in the outline," Glass Henderson says. "He was supposed to move away in the second chapter. To keep him, you must rewrite the beginning of your friendship. But be warned: if you change the beginning, you change who you are." He holds out a Mirror Book. If you touch it, you can go back to the day you met Toby.
If you touch the Mirror Book to rewrite the past, TURN TO PAGE 183.
If you refuse and demand Toby be returned to the present, TURN TO PAGE 184.
Page 170
The interior of the clock tower is a maze of bronze gears the size of houses. In the very center, you see Toby. He is suspended in a web of golden hair-springs. Every time a giant gear turns, he winces. His "quirky" energy is being converted into time itself. "If we stop the gears, we stop time," Sam says. "But if time stops, we might be stuck here forever." High above, the giant Owl-Teacher perches on a pendulum. "The clock must strike twelve," it hoots. "Twelve is the end of the chapter. Choose your exit, Detectives."
If you jam the gears with Sam’s backpack, TURN TO PAGE 185.
If you try to untie Toby while the gears are moving, TURN TO PAGE 186.
Page 171
"Free Toby!" you yell. You dive toward the chalkboard, pulling the multi-tool from your pocket. The clock-eyed students lunge at you. "Hurry, Leo!" Sam screams. You reach the copper wire. It’s pulsing with energy. You snap the wire cutters shut. SNIP. A massive blue spark throws you across the room. The ticking sound stops instantly. Toby’s eyes fly open—they are his normal eyes. "Leo?" he groans. But the school building begins to groan. Without the "Battery," Monday is collapsing. The walls are turning into liquid shadows. "The exit is the window!" Toby yells. "Jump into Tuesday!" TURN TO PAGE 187.
Page 172
"The clock is the heart of the loop!" you shout. "Smash it!" You and Sam grab a heavy metal trophy and hurl it at the giant clock face above the teacher’s desk. CRASH! The glass shatters. The clock-eyed students freeze mid-step. The copper wire connected to Toby turns into dust. He slides down the wall, gasping. "You... you broke it," he whispers. But with the clock smashed, the Forbidden Woods are flooding into the classroom. Vines are growing through the floor, and the sun outside is turning into a giant, unblinking eye. TURN TO PAGE 188.
Page 173
The Owl-Teacher bows its head. "A clever answer." The chessboard folds completely, turning into a paper airplane. It flies into your hand. "The airplane will lead you to the 'Unwritten Page,'" the Owl hoots. "There, you will find your friend. But be careful—the Editor is looking for a 'Tragic Ending'." The paper airplane takes off, glowing with yellow light. You follow it until you reach a massive blank canyon. Toby is at the bottom, surrounded by giant black ink-spiders.
If you use the paper airplane to fly down and rescue him, TURN TO PAGE 189.
If you try to 'edit' the spiders out of the story, TURN TO PAGE 190.
Page 174
The vortex spits you out into the middle of a school gym. But the floor is made of mirrors. Toby is there, standing on his head in the center of the court. "Hey guys," he says. "The cat said you’d be here five minutes ago." Shadow the cat sits on Toby’s feet. "Toby! We’ve been through a nebula for you!" Sam yells. "I know," Toby says. "But look. The cat found the 'Master Remote'." He holds up a small, glowing stone. "If we press this, we go back to the cafeteria. But we’ll lose all our memories of the Woods. If we don't, we stay here. In the Wildcard world."
If you press the stone to return to your normal lives, TURN TO PAGE 191.
If you stay in the Wildcard world forever, TURN TO PAGE 192.
Page 175
The Librarian vanishes into moths, leaving behind her ledger. "She’s gone," Maya whispers. You look at the boring Toby. He starts to change. His hair gets messy. He grows a dinosaur sticker on his shirt. He starts to whistle a song Toby always whistles. "Toby?" you ask. The boy grins. "I convinced the Editor. I told him a story with only perfect characters is a story that nobody reads. He let me stay... but on one condition. One of us has to take the Librarian's place. Someone has to make sure the stories don't glitch again."
If you volunteer to stay so your friends can go home, TURN TO PAGE 193.
If you try to trick the Ledger into letting you all go, TURN TO PAGE 194.
Page 176
The paper moths swarm in a white cyclone. "The narrative cannot survive a 'Rejected' stamp!" the Librarian shrieks. "The world is being deleted!" You find yourself back in the Forbidden Woods, but the trees look like they were drawn with shaky charcoal lines. Toby’s hands are vibrating so fast they look blurry. "I feel like a thought that’s being forgotten," he says. Suddenly, Shadow the cat leaps into the moths. He begins to grow until he is the size of a panther. He swallows the Librarian’s ledger. The moths fall to the ground. The sun in the sky is replaced by a giant, blinking SAVE? icon.
If you "Save" the current reality, TURN TO PAGE 195.
If you "Delete" the woods to start over, TURN TO PAGE 196 (Correction: 196/Backmatter).
Page 186
"I'm not stopping the world," you say. "I'm just getting my friend back!" You leap onto the moving pendulum. Maya and Sam hold the hair-springs back. You reach Toby and frantically unbuckle the leather straps. "Leo! Look out!" Toby yells. As Toby is released, a massive surge of "Quirky" energy—a whirlwind of dinosaur stickers and bad puns—explodes from his chest. The Owl-Teacher is caught in the whirlwind and turned into a paper-mache project. You, Sam, Maya, and Toby slide down the pendulum like a playground slide, bursting through the clock face and landing in a pile of autumn leaves. It’s Tuesday. 3:00 PM. You're all on time for the bus.
THE END: GEARS OF FATE.
Page 187
"Tuesday! Jump!" you roar. You, Sam, and Maya grab Toby and dive through the classroom window. You fall through a curtain of shimmering rain. You land on the classroom floor with a thud. Room 4B is exactly as it should be. Toby is sitting at his desk, perfectly safe. "Did we make it?" Sam whispers. You look out the window. The "Forbidden Woods" are gone. But when Mr. Henderson turns around, he has Toby’s orange beanie on his head. And when Toby opens his notebook, the drawings of monsters are moving, waving at you. You jumped into a New Tuesday—one where the magic of the Woods followed you home.
THE END: NEW TUESDAY.
Page 188
The school building groans as the Forbidden Woods swallow it whole. Branches of oak and ivy wrap around the lockers. "The Rift didn't close," Maya says. "It stayed open. We merged." You walk out onto the front steps. The town is half-brick and half-forest. People are walking to work riding giant dragonflies. Toby stands beside you, his eyes glowing with a soft green light. "It’s not so bad, Leo," he says. "The Principal is much nicer now that he’s part tree." You’re still the Detective Club, but now the mysteries you solve involve talking cats. You didn't save your world—you made a better one.
THE END: MERGED REALITY.
Page 189
The paper airplane expands until it’s the size of a hang-glider. You, Sam, and Maya hop on, soaring down. You pull a giant "Pencil-Sword" from the ground as you land. With every strike, the spiders turn into doodles of kittens. You reach Toby and pull him onto the airplane. The Author’s voice booms from the clouds. "Fine! It’s a better ending anyway!" The giant hand appears and presses a gold star onto your forehead. Suddenly, you are in the school library. You have a "Perfect Score" on your math test, Toby is safe, and the woods have been replaced by a community garden.
THE END: ACTION HERO.
Page 190
"I'm not a hero," you say to the sky. "I'm an Editor!" You grab a giant floating "Red Pen" and start slashing at the ink-spiders. You rewrite them. You add wings to one, a top hat to another. "The spiders are no longer a threat!" you declare. "They are now part of Toby’s personal security team!" The spiders bow to Toby and lead him out of the canyon. You return to reality, but you keep the Red Pen. Now, whenever life gets too boring, you make a tiny mark in the air. Suddenly, school lunch turns into pizza. You’re the luckiest kids in school, because you know how to edit the world.
THE END: AUTHOR’S ASSISTANT.
Page 191
"We have to go back," you say. "We belong in the real world." Toby nods. "I miss my mom’s lasagna." You press the stone. There is a flash of white light. You wake up in the cafeteria. You’re eating a square of school pizza. Toby is sitting across from you. "Hey," Sam says. "Why are we all covered in leaves?" "I don't know," you say. "Maybe we fell asleep on the playground?" You don't remember the Woods. You don't remember the Owl. But when you walk past the Forbidden Woods on your way home, you always stop and wave at the trees. You feel like you’re saying hello to an old friend.
THE END: FORGET-ME-NOT.
Page 192
"We're staying," you say, dropping the stone. It shatters on the mirror-floor. The school building dissolves into a forest of candy-cane trees and rivers of soda. Toby cheers. Shadow the cat grows to the size of a lion and offers you a ride. "No more math tests!" Sam yells. You live in the Wildcard world forever. You never grow old, and every day is a new adventure. Sometimes, you see "normal" kids looking into the woods from the playground, and you leave a trail of glowing breadcrumbs to see if they're brave enough to join the club.
THE END: FOREVER WILD.
Page 193
"I'll stay," you say. "The Detective Club needs to get home. Someone has to make sure Toby doesn't get 'unwritten' again." The Librarian’s black ink cape settles onto your shoulders. You aren't a kid anymore—you are the Keeper of the Archive. You wave your hand, and a golden door opens. "Go," you say. "I'll be watching over you. I'll make sure your stories have happy endings." They walk through the door, tears in their eyes. You sit at the desk and open the Ledger. You write: “And they lived happily ever after.” You're a ghost in the library, but you’re the most powerful person in the world.
THE END: GUARDIAN OF STORIES.
Page 194
"I'm not staying, and neither is Toby," you say, grabbing the Ledger. You use your fruit-punch-flavored juice box to pour liquid over the pages. The ink runs and smears. You use your finger to draw a new rule: ALL FRIENDS MUST REMAIN TOGETHER. The Ledger glows with a fierce, rebellious light. The white room shatters. You, Sam, Maya, and Toby are thrown back into the Forbidden Woods. You walk back to school. When you enter Room 4B, Mr. Henderson is there. "You're late," he says, but he's smiling. You look at each other. You broke the rules of reality, but you kept the group together.
THE END: REWRITE THE RULES.
Page 195
YOU HAVE REACHED THE END OF THE ADVENTURES IN ROOM 4B.
Whether you found a bake sale, a secret laboratory, or a rift in time, the Detective Club survived because of your choices. Some endings were happy, some were strange, and some were a little bit spooky. But that’s the beauty of a story—it’s never truly over as long as you can turn back to Page 1 and start a new adventure. Thank you for playing. Keep your eyes open, watch out for black cats with white ears, and never, ever trust a substitute teacher named Ms. Grimm.
THE END.

THE SECRET HISTORY OF OAKHAVEN
Oakhaven Elementary was built in 1952. Depending on who you ask, it sits on a perfectly normal plot of land, an old government research site, or a "Thin Place" where the walls between our world and the world of stories are thin. Ms. Grimm remains a mystery. Is she a substitute? An agent? Or a static entity? The truth depends entirely on which page you turned to.
